Mall is a simple e-commerce system built developed with modern and popular technologies, such as Spring Boot, MyBatis, Maven, Docker, and Docker Compose.

In the mall, Maven's project inheritance is implemented by defining a parent module that contains shared dependencies, plugins, and configuration settings in a centralized POM file, which all other modules reference in their <parent> element. 
While all module inherits these predefined configurations from the parent module, in mall, each module overwrites some of these configurations, such as the groupID.

The project structure of the first two levels of mall is as follows:

mall/
├── mall-admin/ # Backend mall management system API
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src/
├── mall-common/ # utility classes and common code
