Mall-swarm is a microservice mall system that uses core technologies such as Spring Cloud, Spring Boo, MyBatis, Elasticsearch, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

In the mall-swarm, Maven's project inheritance is implemented by defining a parent module that contains shared dependencies, plugins, and configuration settings in a centralized POM file, which all other modules reference in their <parent> element. 
While all module inherits these predefined configurations from the parent module, in mall-swarm, each module overwrites some of these configurations, such as the groupID.

The project structure of the first two levels of mall-swarm is as follows:
