Spring-Cloud-Platform is a microservice development platform based on Spring Cloud, featuring a unified authorization and authentication backend management system. 
It includes multiple modules such as user management, resource and permission management, and gateway API management 
The core technologies used are Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Cloud Alibaba, Maven, Docker, and Docker-Compose.

In the Spring-Cloud-Platform project, Maven's project inheritance is implemented by defining a parent module that contains shared dependencies, plugins, and configuration settings in a centralized POM file, which all other modules reference in their <parent> element. 
Each module inherits these predefined configurations from the parent module, ensuring a consistent build environment and simplifying dependency management across the entire project.

The project structure of the first two levels of Spring-Cloud-Platform is as follows:
