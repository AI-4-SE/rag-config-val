Verify the values of these configuration options: both are set to 'druid'.\n3. Determine if there is any context or documentation indicating that these values must be identical for the system to function correctly.\n4. Evaluate if the identical values are coincidental or if they are required to be the same due to a functional dependency.\n5.

  ""rationale"": ""The configuration options 'spring.datasource.druid.stat-view-servlet.login-password' in both 'mall-admin' and 'mall-search' have the same value 'druid'. However, there is no context or documentation provided that indicates these values must be identical for the system to function correctly. The identical values could be coincidental and not necessarily indicative of a dependency. Without additional information suggesting a functional requirement for these values to be the same, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no value-equality dependency."",
