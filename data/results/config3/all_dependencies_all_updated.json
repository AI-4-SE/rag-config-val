By taking advantage\n> of Docker caching, you can avoid unnecessary rebuilds and ensure that your\n> Docker images are built as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\n# Use a .dockerignore file\n\nWhen Dockerizing a Spring Boot application, it\u2019s important to use a\n`.dockerignore` file to _exclude_ unnecessary files and directories from the\nDocker build context. The build context is the set of files and directories\nused by Docker to build the Docker image. By using a `.dockerignore` file, you\ncan exclude files and directories that are not required by the Docker image,\nreducing the size of the build context and improving the build performance.\nHere\u2019s an example `.dockerignore` file for a Spring Boot application:\n\n    \n    \n    # Ignore all files in the root directory  \n    *  \n    # Include the src directory  \n    !src/  \n    # Include the pom.xml file  \n    !pom.xml  \n    # Exclude the target directory and its contents  \n    target/\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re using the `.dockerignore` file to exclude all files in\nthe root directory (`*`), except for the `src/` directory and the `pom.xml`\nfile, which are required for building the Spring Boot application. We're also\nexcluding the `target/` directory, which contains the built artifacts and is\nnot required by the Docker image.\n\nBy using a `.dockerignore` file, we can reduce the _size_ of the build context\nand improve the build performance. Docker will only copy the files and\ndirectories that are included in the build context, and will ignore the files\nand directories that are excluded in the `.dockerignore` file.\n\nIf the health check fails, the\ncontainer will be marked as `unhealthy`, and you can use tools like Docker\nCompose or Kubernetes to automatically recover or scale the container.\n\n> Using health checks in this way can help improve the reliability and\n> availability of your Dockerized Spring Boot application. By using health\n> checks, you can automatically detect and recover from issues in your\n> application, ensuring that your application is always available to your\n> users.\n\n# Use Docker caching\n\nWhen Dockerizing a Spring Boot application, it\u2019s important to use Docker\ncaching to speed up the build process and reduce the time it takes to build a\nnew Docker image._Docker caching allows you to reuse previously built layers\nof your Docker image, avoiding the need to rebuild those layers each time you\nbuild a new image_. Here\u2019s an example Dockerfile that uses Docker caching to\nspeed up the build process:\n\n    \n    \n    FROM openjdk:11 as builder  \n    WORKDIR /app  \n    COPY pom.xml .  \n    RUN mvn dependency:go-offline  \n      \n    COPY src/ ./src/  \n    RUN mvn package -DskipTests  \n      \n    FROM openjdk:11  \n    COPY --from=builder /app/target/my-application.jar app.jar  \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/app.jar\"]\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re using a multi-stage build to first build the Spring\nBoot application in a separate layer, and then copy the built jar file into\nthe final image. By using a separate layer for the build process, we can take\nadvantage of Docker caching to avoid rebuilding the dependencies each time we\nbuild a new image.\n\nThe first stage of the build process uses the `openjdk:11` base image and\ncopies the `pom.xml` file to the container. It then runs the `mvn\ndependency:go-offline` command to download all the dependencies required by\nthe application. This command ensures that all the required dependencies are\navailable locally, which will speed up the subsequent builds.\n\nThe second stage of the build process uses the `openjdk:11` base image and\ncopies the source code to the container. It then runs the `mvn package`\ncommand to build the application jar file. Since we have already downloaded\nthe dependencies in the previous stage, Docker will use the cached layer and\nskip the dependency download step.\n\nDocker will only copy the files and\ndirectories that are included in the build context, and will ignore the files\nand directories that are excluded in the `.dockerignore` file.\n\nUsing a `.dockerignore` file is a good practice for Dockerizing a Spring Boot\napplication, as it helps ensure that the Docker image is built as efficiently\nand quickly as possible.\n\nFurthermore, using a `.dockerignore` file can also help improve the _security_\nof your Docker image. By excluding unnecessary files and directories, you can\nreduce the attack surface of your Docker image and minimize the risk of\nexposing sensitive information or credentials. For example, if you have\nconfiguration files or credentials stored in the build directory, excluding\nthem in the `.dockerignore` file will prevent them from being included in the\nDocker image.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the `.dockerignore` file follows a similar syntax\nto the `.gitignore` file, which is used to exclude files and directories from\nGit repositories. If you're familiar with the `.gitignore` file, you should\nfind the `.dockerignore` file easy to use.\n\n> In summary, using a `.dockerignore` file is a good practice for Dockerizing\n> a Spring Boot application. It can help reduce the size of the build context,\n> improve the build performance, and improve the security of your Docker\n> image.\n\n# Use Labels\n\nWhen Dockerizing a Spring Boot application, it\u2019s important to use labels to\nadd _metadata_ to your Docker image. Labels are key-value pairs that can be\nadded to a Docker image to provide additional information about the image,\nsuch as the version, maintainer, or build date. Here\u2019s an example Dockerfile\nthat uses labels to add metadata to a Spring Boot application:\n\n    \n    \n    FROM openjdk:11  \n    LABEL maintainer=\"John Doe <john.doe@example.com>\"  \n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"  \n    LABEL description=\"My Spring Boot application\"  \n    COPY target/my-application.jar app.jar  \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/app.jar\"]\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re using the `LABEL` instruction to add metadata to the\nDocker image. We've added labels for the maintainer, version, and description\nof the image. These labels provide additional information about the Docker\nimage and help users understand what the image contains and how it was built.\n\ncom%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2Fde2fc03c6a42&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fthefreshwrites%2Fthe-\nway-of-dockerize-a-spring-boot-and-mysql-application-with-docker-compose-\nde2fc03c6a42&source=-----de2fc03c6a42---------------------\nbookmark_footer-----------)\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\n**Pre-requisite** ,  \n\u2014 Basic knowledge of docker and java with spring boot  \n\u2014 Setup Docker and Docker compose to local machine\n\n**Technology Stack**  \n\\+ Spring Boot 3.0.0-RELEASE  \n\\+ Spring Data JPA  \n\\+ MySQL \u2014 8.0  \n\\+ Docker \u2014 version 20.10.21  \n\\+ Docker-Compose \u2014 version v2.13.0\n\nYou can get instruction about docker installation from\n<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>.I have downloaded\ndocker desktop to my local pc and It is wrapped up docker with docker compose.\nSo no need to install docker compose separately.\n\n# Overview\n\nMy sample application provide GET api for display list of person\u2019s names.

Or is this a case of a general warning when any\nexpression, regardless of whether it's project.parent.version, is used for the\nversion element.\n\nUse 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0.

If no version satisfies all\nthe hard requirements, the build fails.\n\n#### Version Order Specification:\n\nIf version strings are syntactically correct [Semantic Versioning\n1.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html) version numbers, then in almost\nall cases version comparison follows the precedence rules outlined in that\nspecification. These versions are the commonly encountered alphanumeric ASCII\nstrings such as 2.15.2-alpha. More precisely, this is true if both version\nnumbers to be compared match the \"valid semver\" production in the BNF grammar\nin the semantic versioning specification. Maven does not consider any\nsemantics implied by that specification.\n\n**Important** : This is only true for Semantic Versioning _1.0.0_. The Maven\nversion order algorithm is not compatible with Semantic Versioning _2.0.0_. In\nparticular, Maven does not special case the plus sign or consider build\nidentifiers.\n\nWhen version strings do not follow semantic versioning, a more complex set of\nrules is required.\n\nNotice that `modelVersion` contains 4.0.0. That is currently the only\nsupported POM version, and is always required.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <!-- The Basics -->\n      <groupId>...</groupId>\n      <artifactId>...</artifactId>\n      <version>...</version>\n      <packaging>...</packaging>\n      <dependencies>...</dependencies>\n      <parent>...</parent>\n      <dependencyManagement>...</dependencyManagement>\n      <modules>...</modules>\n      <properties>...</properties>\n    \n      <!-- Build Settings -->\n      <build>...</build>\n      <reporting>...</reporting>\n    \n      <!-- More Project Information -->\n      <name>...</name>\n      <description>...</description>\n      <url>...</url>\n      <inceptionYear>...</inceptionYear>\n      <licenses>...</licenses>\n      <organization>...</organization>\n      <developers>...</developers>\n      <contributors>...</contributors>\n    \n      <!-- Environment Settings -->\n      <issueManagement>...</issueManagement>\n      <ciManagement>...</ciManagement>\n      <mailingLists>...</mailingLists>\n      <scm>...</scm>\n      <prerequisites>...</prerequisites>\n      <repositories>...</repositories>\n      <pluginRepositories>...</pluginRepositories>\n      <distributionManagement>...</distributionManagement>\n      <profiles>...</profiles>\n    </project>\n\n# The Basics\n\nThe POM contains all necessary information about a project, as well as\nconfigurations of plugins to be used during the build process. It is the\ndeclarative manifestation of the \"who\", \"what\", and \"where\", while the build\nlifecycle is the \"when\" and \"how\". That is not to say that the POM cannot\naffect the flow of the lifecycle - it can. For example, by configuring the\n`maven-antrun-plugin`, one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is\nultimately a declaration, however.",

Are there actually some more or less official instructions?\n\n  * [typescript](/questions/tagged/typescript \"show questions tagged 'typescript'\")\n  * [npm](/questions/tagged/npm \"show questions tagged 'npm'\")\n  * [typescript-typings](/questions/tagged/typescript-typings \"show questions tagged 'typescript-typings'\")\n  * [package.json](/questions/tagged/package.json \"show questions tagged 'package.json'\")\n\n[Share](/q/45176661 \"Short permalink to this question\")\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jul 18, 2017 at 20:40\n\n[![kamyl's user\navatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e86aa5e5eeb7d8a01d5934d8f9b8f6bc?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-\nversion=2)](/users/4530649/kamyl)\n\n[kamyl](/users/4530649/kamyl)kamyl\n\n6,26644 gold badges2424 silver badges2929 bronze badges\n\n3\n\n  * Are you generating a bundle or is this a package that will be used by others?

To assist in ensuring the value is only specified\nonce, Maven allows you to use both your own and pre-defined variables in the\nPOM.\n\nFor example, to access the `project.version` variable, you would reference it\nlike so:\n\n    \n    \n      <version>${project.version}</version>\n\nOne factor to note is that these variables are processed _after_ inheritance\nas outlined above. This means that if a parent project uses a variable, then\nits definition in the child, not the parent, will be the one eventually used.\n\n### Available Variables\n\n#### Project Model Variables\n\nAny field of the model that is a single value element can be referenced as a\nvariable. For example, `${project.groupId}`, `${project.version}`,\n`${project.build.sourceDirectory}` and so on. Refer to the POM reference to\nsee a full list of properties.\n\nThese variables are all referenced by the prefix \"`project.`\". You may also\nsee references with `pom.` as the prefix, or the prefix omitted entirely -\nthese forms are now deprecated and should not be used.\n\n#### Special Variables\n\n`project.basedir` | The directory that the current project resides in.  \n---|---  \n`project.baseUri` | The directory that the current project resides in, represented as an URI. _Since Maven 2.1.0_  \n`maven.build.timestamp` | The timestamp that denotes the start of the build (UTC). _Since Maven 2.1.0-M1_  \n  \nThe format of the build timestamp can be customized by declaring the property\n`maven.build.timestamp.format` as shown in the example below:\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      ...\n      <properties>\n        <maven.build.timestamp.format>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'</maven.build.timestamp.format>\n      </properties>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nThe format pattern has to comply with the rules given in the API documentation\nfor\n[SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\nIf the property is not present, the format defaults to the value already given\nin the example.\n\nWhen executing a task or goal, Maven\nlooks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed\nconfiguration information, then executes the goal.\n\nSome of the configuration that can be specified in the POM are the project\ndependencies, the plugins or goals that can be executed, the build profiles,\nand so on. Other information such as the project version, description,\ndevelopers, mailing lists and such can also be specified.\n\n[[top]](./introduction-to-the-pom.html)\n\n## Super POM\n\nThe Super POM is Maven's default POM. All POMs extend the Super POM unless\nexplicitly set, meaning the configuration specified in the Super POM is\ninherited by the POMs you created for your projects.\n\nYou can see the [Super POM for the latest Maven 3 release](/maven-model-\nbuilder/super-pom.html) in Maven Core reference documentation.\n\n[[top]](./introduction-to-the-pom.html)\n\n## Minimal POM\n\nThe minimum requirement for a POM are the following:\n\n  * `project` root\n  * `modelVersion` \\- should be set to 4.0.0\n  * `groupId` \\- the id of the project's group.\n  * `artifactId` \\- the id of the artifact (project)\n  * `version` \\- the version of the artifact under the specified group\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1</version>\n    </project>\n\nA POM requires that its groupId, artifactId, and version be configured. These\nthree values form the project's fully qualified artifact name. This is in the\nform of <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>. As for the example above, its fully\nqualified artifact name is \"com.mycompany.app:my-app:1\".\n\nAlso, as mentioned in the first section, if the configuration details are not\nspecified, Maven will use their defaults. One of these default values is the\npackaging type. Every Maven project has a packaging type. If it is not\nspecified in the POM, then the default value \"jar\" would be used.",

Other information such as the project version, description,\ndevelopers, mailing lists and such can also be specified.\n\n[[top]](./introduction-to-the-pom.html)\n\n## Super POM\n\nThe Super POM is Maven's default POM. All POMs extend the Super POM unless\nexplicitly set, meaning the configuration specified in the Super POM is\ninherited by the POMs you created for your projects.\n\nYou can see the [Super POM for the latest Maven 3 release](/maven-model-\nbuilder/super-pom.html) in Maven Core reference documentation.\n\n[[top]](./introduction-to-the-pom.html)\n\n## Minimal POM\n\nThe minimum requirement for a POM are the following:\n\n  * `project` root\n  * `modelVersion` \\- should be set to 4.0.0\n  * `groupId` \\- the id of the project's group.\n  * `artifactId` \\- the id of the artifact (project)\n  * `version` \\- the version of the artifact under the specified group\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1</version>\n    </project>\n\nA POM requires that its groupId, artifactId, and version be configured. These\nthree values form the project's fully qualified artifact name. This is in the\nform of <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>. As for the example above, its fully\nqualified artifact name is \"com.mycompany.app:my-app:1\".\n\nAlso, as mentioned in the first section, if the configuration details are not\nspecified, Maven will use their defaults. One of these default values is the\npackaging type. Every Maven project has a packaging type. If it is not\nspecified in the POM, then the default value \"jar\" would be used.",
