The groupId is a unique identifier for the project and does not need to match the parent POM's groupId for the project to function correctly. Therefore, the configuration options project.groupId and project.parent_mall.groupId do not depend on each other due to value-equality."",

  ""rationale"": ""The configuration option 'spring.h2.console.enabled' is used to enable the H2 database console in a Spring Boot application, which is a development-time feature to access the in-memory database via a web interface. On the other hand, 'project.build.plugins.plugin_maven-jar-plugin.configuration.archive.manifest.addDefaultSpecificationEntries' is a Maven configuration option that determines whether default specification entries should be added to the JAR manifest during the build process. These two configuration options serve entirely different purposes: one is related to the runtime behavior of a Spring Boot application, and the other is related to the build process of a Maven project. There is no logical or functional connection between enabling the H2 console and adding default specification entries to the JAR manifest. Therefore, the fact that both options are set to 'true' is purely coincidental and does not indicate a dependency."",

While both values are identical, this does not necessarily imply a functional dependency. The Maven configuration is used for dependency management during the build process, whereas the Docker configuration is used for copying files into a Docker image.
