"You are a full-stack expert in validating intra-technology and cross-technology configuration dependencies.
You will be presented with configuration options found in the software project 'mall'.
Your task is to determine whether the given configuration options actually depend on each other based on value-equality.

A value-equality dependency is present if two configuration options must have identical values in order to function correctly.
Inconsistencies in these configuration values can lead to configuration errors. 
Importantly, configuration options may have equal values by accident, meaning that there is no actual dependency, but it just happens that they have equal values.
Information about both configuration options, including their descriptions and prior usages are stated below:

Title: How to handle Docker-Secrets in application.properties files
Post Body:
How do you inject Docker secrets (files/data from /run/secrets) into the application.properties files? Is it safe to use environment variables?
Accepted Answer:
First of all, usage of environment variables for secret data for the application.properties isn't safe.
You have mainly two options when talking about Secrets.
If you are using Docker Secrets without Docker Swarm then you can directly load the whole application.properties in a secret, mount it under
/run/secrets and refer to it as configuration file with the Spring flags.
If you are using Docker Secrets with Docker Swarm then you can just store as secret the concrete fields that you're interested in and relate to them using the
Configuration Templates of Swarm.
Example:
echo -n ""myUser"" | docker secret create db_user - echo -n ""myPass"" | docker secret create db_password - echo -n ""jdbc://..."" | docker secret create db_url - 
application.properties.tmpl
spring.datasource.url={{ secret ""db_url"" }} spring.datasource.user={{ secret ""db_user"" }} spring.datasource.password={{ secret ""db_password"" }} 
docker-compose.yml
version: '3.9' services:   api:     image: yourapp:1.0.0   configs:     - source: application.properties       target: /usr/app/config/application.properties   secrets:     - db_url     - db_user     - db_password  configs:   application.properties:     template_driver: golang     file: ./application.properties.tmpl     name: myapp.application.properties  secrets:   db_url:     external: true   db_user:     external: true   db_password:     external: true 
When you deploy with docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myapp, it will automatically populate the configuration with the contents of the
secrets and it will mount it in the destination path.
Highest Rated Answer:
The best way to use docker secrets in application.properties seems to be using configuration trees.
If your docker secrets get mounted to /run/secrets (which is the default) then you just need to put
spring.config.import=optional:configtree:/run/secrets/ at the top of application.properties.

The meaning of each configuration is already listed in the code.

Next, open the StatViewServlet configuration, as follows.

    spring.datasource.druid.stat-view-servlet.deny=

Just configure the page address and configure the black and white list.

**Note that the reset-enable property will be displayed even if it is set to
false, the reset button will just not be reset by clicking it.**

Okay, that's it.

## 3\. Testing

Next, we start the Spring Boot project for testing.

After the Spring Boot project starts successfully, first visit the following
link.

  * `http://localhost:8080/druid/login.html`

At this point we will see the login authentication page as follows.

![druid login](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/springcloud-community/image-
bucket/2022/02/15/655aae32e30746bf83279193a8f5d11e.png)

Enter the username/password we configured earlier (javaboy/123) to log in, and
after successful login, you can see the following page.

!
---------------------
Given the context information, perform the following task:
Carefully evaluate whether configuration option spring.datasource.druid.stat-view-servlet.login-password of type PASSWORD with value druid in mall-admin/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml of technology spring     depends on configuration option spring.datasource.druid.stat-view-servlet.login-password of type PASSWORD with value druid in mall-search/src/main/resources/application-prod.yml of technology spring or vice versa.

    implementation group: 'org.springframework.boot', name: 'spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'

## 3\. H2 Database Configuration

### 3.1. Default Auto-configuration

If we do not provide any custom properties in `application.properties` file,
by default, Spring boot JPA starter configures `HikariDataSource` connection
pooling and H2 database with the following options:

  * Driver Class : _org.h2.Driver_
  * JDBC URL : _Auto-generated_
  * User Name : _sa_
  * Password : _< blank>_
  * H2 Console : _Disabled_

To get the _auto-generated JDBC URL_ , enable the debug logging with
`logging.level.root=DEBUG` in properties file and watch out in console logs
for the generated URL.

In given example, the JDBC URL name is _c596a281-f6a7-4552-b66b-ce2840d8de28_.

    
    
    2021-12-25 18:12:31.152 DEBUG - HikariPool-1 - Added connection conn0: url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb user=SA
    ...
    2021-12-25 18:12:31.160 INFO  - H2 console available at '/h2'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:testdb'

### 3.2. Custom H2 Configuration

We can customize how Spring boot initializes the H2 DB using the respective
properties configuration.

  *  _spring.h2.console.enabled_ : Enables the console view.
  *  _spring.h2.console.path_ : the h2 console URL.
  *  _spring.datasource.url_ : Custom database URL.
  *  _spring.datasource.driverClassName_ : Custom database driver.
  *  _spring.datasource.username_ : Custom DB username to connect to database.
  *  _spring.datasource.password_ : Custom DB password to connect to database.

Title: Are spring-boot command line properties available when using spring-boot:run?
Post Body:
The short question:
How can you configure environment profiles, or even just an alternative configuration file name for spring-boot:run?
The long version:
Yes, I read the doc. http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html
I have my application configuration settings in src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties:
# Specify the DBMS spring.jpa.database = MYSQL  # Other Mysql config properties  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create 
There is a corresponding application-hsql.properties, which contains the same set of configuration options for Hsql. There is no application.poperties
There is a corresponding import.sql:
insert into users(name, email) values ('User One',  'one@email.com') insert into users(name, email) values ('Two User', 'two@email.com') 
The unit tests exist only to check for the presence of these users in the repo.
I believe it to be true that whenever the test is run using the MySql configuration, those rows are added to the users table. When the test is run with hsql, the
mysql db should be unaffected. I am manually dropping the users table between runs, because I want to manually see when it exists.
1) If I run mvn test, the tests use the configured db:
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql clean test  
Produces mysql database rows and
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=hsql clean test  
Does not.
2) If I make a package, and then run the resulting jar file, I am able to specify a config file name:
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql  ./target/app.jar 
3) If I run with spring-boot:run, only properties in application.properties (which doesn't exist in this test scenario) are discovered.
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql clean spring-boot:run 
What does spring-boot:run do differently in launching than running unit tests and kicking off the jar? The db config is one example, but in theory I'd like to be able
to specify a set of dev configs when the application is being run locally vs. a production configuration.

Most projects depend on others to
build and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you
have gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,
as well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings
in the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing
your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  
You will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven
coordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of
this project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that
matches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there
can be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values
should be:

    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,
    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.

Since the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:
""This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!"" The answer
is, ""Of course, but that's a good thing."" This forces you to depend solely on
dependencies that Maven can manage.

There are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the
central Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that
has a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central
repository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.

    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.

I manage a large propriety system that's compromised of about a dozen services in java. We have a core set of java libs that these all share ), and all the
components/apps are built using maven. Outside of the core SDK jars though each app has its own unique set of dependencies. I can't figure out what the best
approach is to both building and deploying inside docker. Ideally I want the entire lifecycle in docker, using a multi-stage build approach. But, I can't see how to
optimize this with the huge number of dependencies.
It looks like I can do 2 approaches.
Build as we have before, using maven and a common cache on the CI server (jenkins) so that dependencies are fetched once and cached, and accessible to
all the apps. Then have a dockerfile for each app that just copies the product jar and it's dependencies (or a fat jar) into the container, and set it up to execute.
Downside of this approach is that the build itself is something that could differ between developers and the CI server. Potentially use a local maven cache like
nexus just to avoid pulling deps from the internet everytime? But that still doesn't solve the problem that a dev build won't necessarily match the CI build
environment.
Use multi-stage dockerfile for each project. I've tried this, and it does work and I managed to get the maven dependencies layer to cache so that it doesn't
fetch too often. Unfortunately that intermediate build layer was hitting 1-2gb per application, and I can't remove the 'dangling' intermediates from the daemon
or all the caching is blowing away. It also means there's a tremendous amount of duplication in the jars that have to be downloaded for each application if
something changes in the poms. (ie they all use junit and log4j and many other similarities)
Is there a way to solve this optimally that I'm not seeing?

It defines the versions of all the
artifacts that will be created in the library. Other projects that wish to use
the library should import this POM into the dependencyManagement section of
their POM.

Given the context information, perform the following task:
Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_apollo-portal.artifactId of type NAME with value apollo-portal in apollo-assembly/pom.xml of technology maven     depends on configuration option COPY.src of type PATH with value apollo-portal in apollo-portal/src/main/docker/Dockerfile of technology docker or vice versa.

Respond in a JSON format as shown below:
{{
  “plan”: string, // Write down a step-by-step plan on how to solve the task given the information above.
  “rationale”: string, // Provide a concise explanation of whether and why the configuration options depend on each other due to value-equality.
  “uncertainty”: integer, // Rate your certainty of this dependency on a scale from 0 (completely uncertain) to 10 (absolutely certain), given the context, plan, and rationale.
  “isDependency”: boolean // True if a dependency exists, or False otherwise.

Title: Skip maven deploy for one module
Post Body:
I have a multi-module maven project. Parent pom looks like this:
<project>     ...     <packaging>pom</packaging>        <modules>         <module>common</module>         <module>a</module>         <module>b</module>     </modules> </project> 
common builds a jar, which is added as dependency in the other modules, like this:
<dependency>     <groupId>my.project</groupId>     <artifactId>common</artifactId>     <version>${module.common.version}</version> </dependency> 
Modules a and b are Spring Boot projects having the spotify docker plugin.
I need to be able to run mvn deploy in order to get the spotify plugin push the docker image.
mvn install works fine, which builds the docker images. But in order to push them, when I run mvn deploy, it throws error for the common module:
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin:2.7:deploy (default-deploy) on project common: Deployment failed:
repository element was not specified in the POM inside distributionManagement element or in -DaltDeploymentRepository=id::layout::url parameter
Searching for this error, this answer suggests adding the repository url in the distributionManagement section. But I don't want to deploy common. I just
want to build it, so it gets injected as dependency in the other modules and deploy those other modules. How can I do that?
I tried to deploy only a and b using this command, but it gives the same error for common:
mvn clean \    -DdockerRegistryHost=123.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/test1 \    --projects a,b \    --also-make \    deploy 
Accepted Answer:
You can accomplish what you want by configuring the maven-deploy-plugin.

#### The Solution

The answer? - the same way as Example 3, by specifying the path to the module.

    
    
    <project>
      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    
      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
      <version>1</version>
      <packaging>pom</packaging>
    
      <modules>
        <module>../my-module</module>
      </modules>
    </project>

## Project Inheritance vs Project Aggregation

If you have several Maven projects, and they all have similar configurations,
you can refactor your projects by pulling out those similar configurations and
making a parent project. Thus, all you have to do is to let your Maven
projects inherit that parent project, and those configurations would then be
applied to all of them.

And if you have a group of projects that are built or processed together, you
can create a parent project and have that parent project declare those
projects as its modules. By doing so, you'd only have to build the parent and
the rest will follow.

But of course, you can have both Project Inheritance and Project Aggregation.
Meaning, you can have your modules specify a parent project, and at the same
time, have that parent project specify those Maven projects as its modules.
You'd just have to apply all three rules:

  * Specify in every child POM who their parent POM is.
  * Change the parent POMs packaging to the value ""pom"" .

A `pom`
packaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them
as modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of

You do not need to consider the inter-module dependencies yourself when
listing the modules; i.e. the ordering of the modules given by the POM is not
important. Maven will topologically sort the modules such that dependencies
are always build before dependent modules.

To see aggregation in action, have a look at the
[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/pom.xml) base POM.

#### A final note on Inheritance v. Aggregation

Inheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a
single, high-level POM. You often see projects that are both parents and
aggregators. For example, the entire Maven core runs through a single base POM
[`org.apache.maven:maven`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/maven-3/trunk/pom.xml?view=markup),
so building the Maven project can be executed by a single command: `mvn
compile`. However, an aggregator project and a parent project are both POM
projects, they are not one and the same and should not be confused. A POM
project may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have - any modules
that it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do
not inherit from it.

## Properties

Properties are the last required piece to understand POM basics.

You will be presented with configuration options found in the software project 'litemall'.
Your task is to determine whether the given configuration options actually depend on each other based on value-equality.

A value-equality dependency is present if two configuration options must have identical values in order to function correctly.
Inconsistencies in these configuration values can lead to configuration errors. 
Importantly, configuration options may have equal values by accident, meaning that there is no actual dependency, but it just happens that they have equal values.

the benefit is that we can avoid duplicated configurations that are prone to
be missed when changes are done.

Most projects depend on others to
build and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you
have gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,
as well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings
in the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing
your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  
You will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven
coordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of
this project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that
matches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there
can be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values
should be:

    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,
    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.

Since the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:
""This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!"" The answer
is, ""Of course, but that's a good thing."" This forces you to depend solely on
dependencies that Maven can manage.

There are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the
central Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that
has a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central
repository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.

    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.

Title: spring-boot : Exclude dependencies on packaging
Post Body:
I am working on a spring boot project ( Project A ) that would be included in other projects ( Project B, Project C ... ) . I have several dependencies in Project A,
but in the project importing Project A, some or only one may be required. I am trying to find a way to exclude the jar dependencies while packaging Project A so
that the required ones will be provided by Project B during run time. I would like to have the dependencies available when the Project A is run independently for
testing purposes.
Already tried the following
I have tried using:
<scope>provided</scope> <optional>true</optional> 
Still the jars end up in the final artifact.
Also tried adding the following to the spring-boot-maven-plugin
           <plugins>             <plugin>                 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>                 <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>                 <executions>                     <execution>                         <goals>                             <goal>repackage</goal>                         </goals>                         <configuration>                             <excludeArtifactIds>spring-boot-starter-redis</excludeArtifactIds>                         </configuration>                     </execution>                 </executions>             </plugin>         </plugins> 
This would just remove the spring-boot dependency , but the jars for the children of this dependency would still end up in the final artifact.
Accepted Answer:
In our current project we have the requirement to create a war file for the application, which has to be deployed in a JEE server. The war file must include only the
needed jar files, not including any API or implementation already provided by the JEE server.
But, we want to retain the possibility to generate an executable war or jar file as provided by default by Boot, for testing purposes.
To achieve it, we've set all optional dependencies as provided. For example, we have some direct dependencies used in development, like the JDBC driver, we
don't want to include in the deployed war file. Also there are some boot main starters which provide dependencies with other starters and libraries we don't need
in a JEE server. This is the case of the spring-boot-starter-tomcat and spring-boot-starter-jdbc starters.

Notice that `modelVersion` contains 4.0.0. That is currently the only
supported POM version, and is always required.

# The Basics

The POM contains all necessary information about a project, as well as
configurations of plugins to be used during the build process. It is the
declarative manifestation of the ""who"", ""what"", and ""where"", while the build
lifecycle is the ""when"" and ""how"". That is not to say that the POM cannot
affect the flow of the lifecycle - it can. For example, by configuring the
`maven-antrun-plugin`, one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is
ultimately a declaration, however.
---------------------
Given the context information, perform the following task:
Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in gateway/pom.xml of technology maven     depends on configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in registry/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

Respond in a JSON format as shown below:
{{
  “plan”: string, // Write down a step-by-step plan on how to solve the task given the information above.
  “rationale”: string, // Provide a concise explanation of whether and why the configuration options depend on each other due to value-equality.
  “uncertainty”: integer, // Rate your certainty of this dependency on a scale from 0 (completely uncertain) to 10 (absolutely certain), given the context, plan, and rationale.
  “isDependency”: boolean // True if a dependency exists, or False otherwise.
}}

Answer:
 { “plan”:","{
  ""plan"": ""1. Identify the role and significance of the 'modelVersion' configuration option in a Maven POM file. 2. Determine if 'modelVersion' is a global or project-specific setting. 3. Check if 'modelVersion' must be the same across different Maven projects (e.g., gateway/pom.xml and registry/pom.xml) for compatibility or functionality reasons. 4. Evaluate if the 'modelVersion' value being the same in both files is a coincidence or a requirement. 5. Conclude whether there is a value-equality dependency between the 'modelVersion' settings in the two POM files."",
  ""rationale"": ""The 'modelVersion' in a Maven POM file specifies the version of the POM model itself, which dictates the structure and available elements within the POM file. Currently, '4.0.0' is the only supported version, meaning all Maven projects must use this version. Therefore, the 'modelVersion' being the same in both gateway/pom.xml and registry/pom.xml is not due to a project-specific dependency but rather a global requirement of the Maven tool. This means that the identical values are a result of a universal constraint rather than a direct dependency between the two projects."",
  ""uncertainty"": 10,
  ""isDependency"": false
}",False
