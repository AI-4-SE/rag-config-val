      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library. Inside\neach of these, we'll find the actual jar file (e.g. log4j-1.2.12.jar) as well\nas a pom file (this is the `pom.xml` for the dependency, indicating any\nfurther dependencies it might have and other information) and another maven-\nmetadata.xml file. There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files. You can use this to authenticate\nthe library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be\nusing already.\n\nNow that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our\npom.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n          <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nNow, when we compile the project (`mvn compile`), we'll see Maven download the\nlog4j dependency for us.\n\n## How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?",

      "There are few rules that describe their co-\noperation.\n\n  1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.\n\n  2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.\n\n  3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.\n\n  4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.\n\nThe table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` /\n`CMD` combinations:\n\n| No ENTRYPOINT| ENTRYPOINT exec_entry p1_entry| ENTRYPOINT [\"exec_entry\",\n\"p1_entry\"]  \n---|---|---|---  \n **No CMD**|  error, not allowed| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry| exec_entry\np1_entry  \n **CMD [\"exec_cmd\", \"p1_cmd\"]**|  exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n **CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd**|  /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n  \n>  **Note**\n>\n> If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset\n> `CMD` to an empty value. In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the\n> current image to have a value.\n\n## VOLUME\n\n    \n    \n    VOLUME [\"/data\"]\n\nThe `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and\nmarks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other\ncontainers. The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "For more information, see [.dockerignore\nfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).\n\n## Shell and exec form\n\nThe `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions all have two possible forms:\n\n  * `INSTRUCTION [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"]` (exec form)\n  * `INSTRUCTION command param1 param2` (shell form)\n\nThe exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to invoke\ncommands using a specific command shell, or any other executable. It uses a\nJSON array syntax, where each element in the array is a command, flag, or\nargument.\n\nThe shell form is more relaxed, and emphasizes ease of use, flexibility, and\nreadability. The shell form automatically uses a command shell, whereas the\nexec form does not.\n\n### Exec form\n\nThe exec form is parsed as a JSON array, which means that you must use double-\nquotes (\") around words, not single-quotes (').\n\n    \n    \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo hello\"]\n\nThe exec form is best used to specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, combined\nwith `CMD` for setting default arguments that can be overridden at runtime.\nFor more information, see ENTRYPOINT.\n\n#### Variable substitution\n\nUsing the exec form doesn't automatically invoke a command shell. This means\nthat normal shell processing, such as variable substitution, doesn't happen.\nFor example, `RUN [ \"echo\", \"$HOME\" ]` won't handle variable substitution for\n`$HOME`.\n\nIf you want shell processing then either use the shell form or execute a shell\ndirectly with the exec form, for example: `RUN [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo $HOME\" ]`.\nWhen using the exec form and executing a shell directly, as in the case for\nthe shell form, it's the shell that's doing the environment variable\nsubstitution, not the builder.\n\n#### Backslashes\n\nIn exec form, you must escape backslashes. This is particularly relevant on\nWindows where the backslash is the path separator.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing.

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever).

Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",

Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

      "There are few rules that describe their co-\noperation.\n\n  1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.\n\n  2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.\n\n  3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.\n\n  4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.\n\nThe table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` /\n`CMD` combinations:\n\n| No ENTRYPOINT| ENTRYPOINT exec_entry p1_entry| ENTRYPOINT [\"exec_entry\",\n\"p1_entry\"]  \n---|---|---|---  \n **No CMD**|  error, not allowed| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry| exec_entry\np1_entry  \n **CMD [\"exec_cmd\", \"p1_cmd\"]**|  exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n **CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd**|  /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n  \n>  **Note**\n>\n> If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset\n> `CMD` to an empty value. In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the\n> current image to have a value.\n\n## VOLUME\n\n    \n    \n    VOLUME [\"/data\"]\n\nThe `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and\nmarks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other\ncontainers. The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command.",
      "cgroup_parent: m-executor-abcd\n\n## command\n\n`command` overrides the default command declared by the container image, for\nexample by Dockerfile's `CMD`.\n\n    \n    \n    command: bundle exec thin -p 3000\n\nThe value can also be a list, in a manner similar to\n[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd):\n\n    \n    \n    command: [ \"bundle\", \"exec\", \"thin\", \"-p\", \"3000\" ]\n\nIf the value is `null`, the default command from the image is used.\n\nIf the value is `[]` (empty list) or `''` (empty string), the default command\ndeclared by the image is ignored, i.e. overridden to be empty.\n\n## configs\n\nConfigs allow services to adapt their behaviour without the need to rebuild a\nDocker image. Services can only access configs when explicitly granted by the\n`configs` attribute. Two different syntax variants are supported.\n\nCompose reports an error if `config` doesn't exist on the platform or isn't\ndefined in the [`configs` top-level\nelement](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/08-configs/) in the\nCompose file.\n\nThere are two syntaxes defined for configs: a short syntax and a long syntax.\n\nYou can grant a service access to multiple configs, and you can mix long and\nshort syntax.\n\n### Short syntax\n\nThe short syntax variant only specifies the config name. This grants the\ncontainer access to the config and mounts it as files into a service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncontainer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filesystem. The location of the mount point within the container\ndefaults to `/<config_name>` in Linux containers, and `C:\\<config-name>` in\nWindows containers.\n\nThe following example uses the short syntax to grant the `redis` service\naccess to the `my_config` and `my_other_config` configs. The value of\n`my_config` is set to the contents of the file `./my_config.txt`, and\n`my_other_config` is defined as an external resource, which means that it has\nalready been defined in the platform. If the external config does not exist,\nthe deployment fails."

      "The image can be any valid image.\n\n  * `ARG` is the only instruction that may precede `FROM` in the Dockerfile. See Understand how ARG and FROM interact.\n  * `FROM` can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile to create multiple images or use one build stage as a dependency for another. Simply make a note of the last image ID output by the commit before each new `FROM` instruction. Each `FROM` instruction clears any state created by previous instructions.\n  * Optionally a name can be given to a new build stage by adding `AS name` to the `FROM` instruction. The name can be used in subsequent `FROM <name>`, `COPY --from=<name>`, and `RUN --mount=type=bind,from=<name>` instructions to refer to the image built in this stage.\n  * The `tag` or `digest` values are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a `latest` tag by default. The builder returns an error if it can't find the `tag` value.\n\nThe optional `--platform` flag can be used to specify the platform of the\nimage in case `FROM` references a multi-platform image. For example,\n`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, or `windows/amd64`. By default, the target\nplatform of the build request is used.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library.

There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files.

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

The SNAPSHOT is \"older\" than its release.\n\nDuring the [release](../../plugins/maven-release-plugin/) process, a version\nof **x.y-SNAPSHOT** changes to **x.y**.

Padded \"null\" values depend on the\nprefix of the other version: 0 for '.', \"\" for '-'.

Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "You may have noticed that `junit-4.11.jar` was a dependency, but didn't end up\nin the WAR. The reason for this is the `<scope>test</scope>` element - it is\nonly required for testing, and so is not included in the web application as\nthe compile time dependency `my-app` is.\n\nThe final step was to include a parent definition. This ensures that the POM\ncan always be located even if the project is distributed separately from its\nparent by looking it up in the repository.\n\n* * *\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2002\u00e2\u0080\u00932024 [The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)"

      "The extensions do not have to actually do anything nor contain a Mojo.

Certain Maven plugins can generate reports defined and\nconfigured under the reporting element, for example: generating Javadoc\nreports. Much like the build element's ability to configure plugins, reporting\ncommands the same ability. The glaring difference is that rather than fine-\ngrained control of plug-in goals within the executions block, reporting\nconfigures goals within `reportSet` elements. And the subtler difference is\nthat a plugin `configuration` under the `reporting` element works as `build`\nplugin `configuration`, although the opposite is not true (a `build` plugin\n`configuration` does not affect a `reporting` plugin).\n\nPossibly the only item under the `reporting` element that would not be\nfamiliar to someone who understood the `build` element is the Boolean\n`excludeDefaults` element. This element signifies to the site generator to\nexclude reports normally generated by default. When a site is generated via\nthe `site` build cycle, a _Project Info_ section is placed in the left-hand\nmenu, chock full of reports, such as the **Project Team** report or\n**Dependencies** list report. These report goals are generated by `maven-\nproject-info-reports-plugin`. Being a plugin like any other, it may also be\nsuppressed in the following, more verbose, way, which effectively turns off\nproject-info reports."

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "You may have noticed that `junit-4.11.jar` was a dependency, but didn't end up\nin the WAR. The reason for this is the `<scope>test</scope>` element - it is\nonly required for testing, and so is not included in the web application as\nthe compile time dependency `my-app` is.\n\nThe final step was to include a parent definition. This ensures that the POM\ncan always be located even if the project is distributed separately from its\nparent by looking it up in the repository.\n\n* * *\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2002\u00e2\u0080\u00932024 [The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)",

      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library. Inside\neach of these, we'll find the actual jar file (e.g. log4j-1.2.12.jar) as well\nas a pom file (this is the `pom.xml` for the dependency, indicating any\nfurther dependencies it might have and other information) and another maven-\nmetadata.xml file. There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files. You can use this to authenticate\nthe library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be\nusing already.\n\nNow that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our\npom.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n          <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nNow, when we compile the project (`mvn compile`), we'll see Maven download the\nlog4j dependency for us.\n\n## How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?",

It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin.

The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via `exclusions`, or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. `executions` configure the `execution` of a plugin's goals. \n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to bind the `antrun:run` goal to the `verify`\nphase.

Aggregation\n\nInheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a\nsingle, high-level POM. You often see projects that are both parents and\naggregators. For example, the entire Maven core runs through a single base POM\n[`org.apache.maven:maven`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/maven-3/trunk/pom.xml?view=markup),\nso building the Maven project can be executed by a single command: `mvn\ncompile`. However, an aggregator project and a parent project are both POM\nprojects, they are not one and the same and should not be confused. A POM\nproject may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have - any modules\nthat it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do\nnot inherit from it.\n\n## Properties\n\nProperties are the last required piece to understand POM basics."

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository.

How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",
      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`."

Aggregation\n\nInheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a\nsingle, high-level POM. You often see projects that are both parents and\naggregators. For example, the entire Maven core runs through a single base POM\n[`org.apache.maven:maven`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/maven-3/trunk/pom.xml?view=markup),\nso building the Maven project can be executed by a single command: `mvn\ncompile`. However, an aggregator project and a parent project are both POM\nprojects, they are not one and the same and should not be confused. A POM\nproject may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have - any modules\nthat it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do\nnot inherit from it.\n\n## Properties\n\nProperties are the last required piece to understand POM basics.",
      "For example, by configuring the\n`maven-antrun-plugin`, one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is\nultimately a declaration, however. Whereas a `build.xml` tells Ant precisely\nwhat to do when it is run (procedural), a POM states its configuration\n(declarative). If some external force causes the lifecycle to skip the Ant\nplugin execution, it does not stop the plugins that are executed from doing\ntheir magic. This is unlike a `build.xml` file, where tasks are almost always\ndependant on the lines executed before it.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0</version>\n    </project>\n\n## Maven Coordinates\n\nThe POM defined above is the bare minimum that Maven allows.\n`groupId:artifactId:version` are all required fields (although, groupId and\nversion do not need to be explicitly defined if they are inherited from a\nparent - more on inheritance later). The three fields act much like an address\nand timestamp in one. This marks a specific place in a repository, acting like\na coordinate system for Maven projects:\n\n  * **groupId** : This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId `org.apache.maven`. Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository."

      "20.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2200)\n\nA Compose application can declare dependency on another Compose application.\nThis is useful if:\n\n  * You want to reuse other Compose files.\n  * You need to factor out parts of your application model into separate Compose files so they can be managed separately or shared with others.\n  * Teams need to keep a Compose file reasonably complicated for the limited amount of resources it has to declare for it's own sub-domain, within a larger deployment.\n\nThe `include` top-level section is used to define the dependency on another\nCompose application, or sub-domain. Each path listed in the `include` section\nis loaded as an individual Compose application model, with it's own project\ndirectory, in order to resolve relative paths.\n\nOnce the included Compose application is loaded, all resources definitions are\ncopied into the current Compose application model. Compose displays a warning\nif resource names conflict and doesn't try to merge them. To enforce this,\n`include` is evaluated after the Compose file(s) selected to define the\nCompose application model have been parsed and merged, so that conflicts\nbetween Compose files are detected.\n\n`include` applies recursively so an included Compose file which declares its\nown `include` section, triggers those other files to be included as well.\n\nAny volumes, networks, or other resources pulled in from the included Compose\nfile can be used by the current Compose application for cross-service\nreferences. For example:\n\n    \n    \n    include:\n      - my-compose-include.yaml  #with serviceB declared\n    services:\n      serviceA:\n        build: .\n        depends_on:\n          - serviceB #use serviceB directly as if it was declared in this Compose file\n\nCompose also supports the use of interpolated variables with `include`. It's\nrecommended that you [specify mandatory\nvariables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/12-interpolation/).\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n    include:\n      -${INCLUDE_PATH:?FOO}/compose.yaml\n\n## Short syntax\n\nThe short syntax only defines paths to other Compose files. The file is loaded\nwith the parent folder as the project directory, and an optional `.env` file\nthat is loaded to define any variables' default values by interpolation.

      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository.

This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository?

    "response": "{ \"plan\": \n\"1. Review the provided configuration options in the `pom.xml` file.\n2. Identify the relevant configuration options: `project.build.plugins.plugin_spring-boot-maven-plugin.groupId` and `project.dependencies.dependency_spring-boot-starter-test.groupId`.\n3. Analyze the values of these configuration options: `org.springframework.boot` for both options.\n4. Determine if there is a value-equality dependency between these two configuration options based on their identical values.\n\nRationale:\nThe configuration options have identical values (`org.springframework.boot`) which suggests that they might be related in some way. However, without further context or information about the specific plugins and dependencies used in the project, it's difficult to determine if there is a direct dependency between these two options.\n\nUncertainty: 6 (somewhat uncertain)\nThe uncertainty rating is based on the fact that we don't have enough information to conclusively say whether there is a dependency between these two configuration options. However, the identical values do suggest some connection or relationship.\n\nIsDependency: false\nBased on the analysis and rationale provided above, it's difficult to conclude that there is a direct value-equality dependency between these two configuration options. The uncertainty rating suggests that further investigation or context would be needed to determine if there is indeed a dependency.\" }",
