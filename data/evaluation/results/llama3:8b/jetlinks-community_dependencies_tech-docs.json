It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",
      "In our case, the example POM for `org.codehaus.mojo:my-\nproject:1.0` defined above will be packaged as a `jar`.

The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list. Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot."

It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",
      "In our case, the example POM for `org.codehaus.mojo:my-\nproject:1.0` defined above will be packaged as a `jar`. We could make it into\na `war` by declaring a different packaging:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <packaging>war</packaging>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nWhen no packaging is declared, Maven assumes the packaging is the default:\n`jar`. The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list.

It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",
      "In our case, the example POM for `org.codehaus.mojo:my-\nproject:1.0` defined above will be packaged as a `jar`. We could make it into\na `war` by declaring a different packaging:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <packaging>war</packaging>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nWhen no packaging is declared, Maven assumes the packaging is the default:\n`jar`. The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list. Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot."

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository.

Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>. You can also set up your own remote\nrepository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or\nin addition to the default remote repository. For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library."

For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

      "If maven-\ncore appears as a direct or transitive dependency elsewhere in the POM, it can\nstill be added to the classpath.\n\nWildcard excludes make it easy to exclude all of a dependency's transitive\ndependencies.

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

According to the documentation, when a POM extends another POM, certain values are inherited from the parent POM by default. The `combine.children` or `combine.self` attributes can be used to override this behavior for plugin configuration.\n\nNext, I will analyze the Super POM for Maven 3.5.4. The Super POM is the base POM that all Project Object Models inherit from. It defines the basic structure and inheritance rules for Maven projects.\n\nFinally, I will compare the two configuration options in question. Since both options are of type PATH with the same value ../pom.xml, it appears that they do not depend on each other. The `project.parent_jetlinks-components.relativePath` option is used to specify the relative path to the parent POM, and this value does not affect the behavior or dependencies of the project.\n\nRationale: The configuration options are independent because they only specify the relative path to the parent POM, which does not impact the project's dependencies or behavior. \n\nUncertainty: 10 (absolutely certain) that these configuration options do not depend on each other due to value-equality.\n\nIsDependency: False\" }",

It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",

The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list. Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot."

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

      "The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under.

See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals.

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever).

      "When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository. In the example given, the `org.codehaus.mojo` group lives within the directory `$M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo`.\n  * **artifactId** : The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by. Although the groupId is important, people within the group will rarely mention the groupId in discussion (they are often all be the same ID, such as the [MojoHaus](http://www.mojohaus.org/) project groupId: `org.codehaus.mojo`). It, along with the groupId, creates a key that separates this project from every other project in the world (at least, it should :) ). Along with the groupId, the artifactId fully defines the artifact's living quarters within the repository. In the case of the above project, `my-project` lives in `$M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project`.\n  * **version** : This is the last piece of the naming puzzle. `groupId:artifactId` denotes a single project but they cannot delineate which incarnation of that project we are talking about. Do we want the `junit:junit` of 2018 (version 4.12), or of 2007 (version 3.8.2)? In short: code changes, those changes should be versioned, and this element keeps those versions in line. It is also used within an artifact's repository to separate versions from each other. `my-project` version 1.0 files live in the directory structure `$M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project/1.0`.\n\nThe three elements given above point to a specific version of a project,\nletting Maven know _who_ we are dealing with, and _when_ in its software\nlifecycle we want them.\n\n## Packaging\n\nNow that we have our address structure of `groupId:artifactId:version`, there\nis one more standard label to give us a really complete _what_ : that is the\nproject's packaging.

Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via `exclusions`, or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. `executions` configure the `execution` of a plugin's goals. \n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to bind the `antrun:run` goal to the `verify`\nphase. We want the task to echo the build directory, as well as avoid passing\non this configuration to its children (assuming it is a parent) by setting\n`inherited` to `false`. You would get an `execution` like this:\n\n    \n        <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <build>\n        <plugins>\n          <plugin>\n            <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>1.1</version>\n            <executions>\n              <execution>\n                <id>echodir</id>\n                <goals>\n                  <goal>run</goal>\n                </goals>\n                <phase>verify</phase>\n                <inherited>false</inherited>\n                <configuration>\n                  <tasks>\n                    <echo>Build Dir: /home/jenkins/82467a7c/workspace/aven_maven-box_maven-site_master/target</echo>\n                  </tasks>\n                </configuration>\n              </execution>\n            </executions>\n    \n          </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n      </build>\n    </project>\n\n    * **id** : Self explanatory.

      "The release process also increments\nthe development version to **x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT**. For example, version\n**1.0-SNAPSHOT** is released as version **1.0** , and the new development\nversion is version **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.\n\n## How do I use plugins?\n\nWhenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by\nadding or reconfiguring plugins.\n\nFor this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0\nsources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM:\n\n    \n    \n    ...\n    <build>\n      <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n          <version>3.3</version>\n          <configuration>\n            <source>1.5</source>\n            <target>1.5</target>\n          </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n      </plugins>\n    </build>\n    ...\n\nYou'll notice that all plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in\nsome ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",
      "A `pom`\npackaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them\nas modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of\nthose projects.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-parent</artifactId>\n      <version>2.0</version>\n      <packaging>pom</packaging>\n    \n      <modules>\n        <module>my-project</module>\n        <module>another-project</module>\n        <module>third-project/pom-example.xml</module>\n      </modules>\n    </project>\n\nYou do not need to consider the inter-module dependencies yourself when\nlisting the modules; i.e. the ordering of the modules given by the POM is not\nimportant. Maven will topologically sort the modules such that dependencies\nare always build before dependent modules.\n\nTo see aggregation in action, have a look at the\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/pom.xml) base POM.\n\n#### A final note on Inheritance v. Aggregation\n\nInheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a\nsingle, high-level POM. You often see projects that are both parents and\naggregators. For example, the entire Maven core runs through a single base POM\n[`org.apache.maven:maven`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/maven-3/trunk/pom.xml?view=markup),\nso building the Maven project can be executed by a single command: `mvn\ncompile`. However, an aggregator project and a parent project are both POM\nprojects, they are not one and the same and should not be confused. A POM\nproject may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have - any modules\nthat it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do\nnot inherit from it.\n\n## Properties\n\nProperties are the last required piece to understand POM basics."

The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`.

      "The release process also increments\nthe development version to **x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT**. For example, version\n**1.0-SNAPSHOT** is released as version **1.0** , and the new development\nversion is version **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.\n\n## How do I use plugins?\n\nWhenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by\nadding or reconfiguring plugins.\n\nFor this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0\nsources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM:\n\n    \n    \n    ...\n    <build>\n      <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n          <version>3.3</version>\n          <configuration>\n            <source>1.5</source>\n            <target>1.5</target>\n          </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n      </plugins>\n    </build>\n    ...\n\nYou'll notice that all plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in\nsome ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope.

So if project `X` adds project `A` as its own\ndependency, then Maven does not need to install project `B` at all.\nSymbolically, if `=>` represents a required dependency, and `-->` represents\noptional, although `A=>B` may be the case when building A `X=>A-->B` would be\nthe case when building `X`.\n\nIn the shortest terms, `optional` lets other projects know that, when you use\nthis project, you do not require this dependency in order to work correctly.\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nDependencies can be managed in the `dependencyManagement` section to affect\nthe resolution of dependencies which are not fully qualified or to enforce the\nusage of a specific transitive dependency version. Further information in\n[Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism](./guides/introduction/introduction-\nto-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\n#### Dependency Version Requirement Specification\n\nDependencies' `version` elements define version requirements, which are used\nto compute dependency versions. Soft requirements can be replaced by different\nversions of the same artifact found elsewhere in the dependency graph. Hard\nrequirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft\nrequirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the\nhard requirements for that artifact, the build fails.\n\nVersion requirements have the following syntax:\n\n  * `1.0`: Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.\n  * `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.",

You can use this to authenticate\nthe library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be\nusing already.\n\nNow that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our\npom.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n          <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nNow, when we compile the project (`mvn compile`), we'll see Maven download the\nlog4j dependency for us.\n\n## How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?",
      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>. You can also set up your own remote\nrepository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or\nin addition to the default remote repository. For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library.",

Although the majority of the configuration is up to\nthe specific program used (Continuum, Cruise Control, etc.), there are a few\nconfigurations which may take place within the POM. Maven has captured a few\nof the recurring settings within the set of notifier elements. A notifier is\nthe manner in which people are notified of certain build statuses. In the\nfollowing example, this POM is setting a notifier of type `mail` (meaning\nemail), and configuring the email address to use on the specified triggers\n`sendOnError`, `sendOnFailure`, and not `sendOnSuccess` or `sendOnWarning`."
