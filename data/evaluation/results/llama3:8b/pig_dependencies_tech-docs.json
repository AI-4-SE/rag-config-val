      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "In our case, the example POM for `org.codehaus.mojo:my-\nproject:1.0` defined above will be packaged as a `jar`. We could make it into\na `war` by declaring a different packaging:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <packaging>war</packaging>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nWhen no packaging is declared, Maven assumes the packaging is the default:\n`jar`. The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list.

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`."

In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the\n> current image to have a value.\n\n## VOLUME\n\n    \n    \n    VOLUME [\"/data\"]\n\nThe `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and\nmarks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other\ncontainers. The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "For more information, see [.dockerignore\nfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).\n\n## Shell and exec form\n\nThe `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions all have two possible forms:\n\n  * `INSTRUCTION [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"]` (exec form)\n  * `INSTRUCTION command param1 param2` (shell form)\n\nThe exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to invoke\ncommands using a specific command shell, or any other executable. It uses a\nJSON array syntax, where each element in the array is a command, flag, or\nargument.\n\nThe shell form is more relaxed, and emphasizes ease of use, flexibility, and\nreadability. The shell form automatically uses a command shell, whereas the\nexec form does not.\n\n### Exec form\n\nThe exec form is parsed as a JSON array, which means that you must use double-\nquotes (\") around words, not single-quotes (').\n\n    \n    \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo hello\"]\n\nThe exec form is best used to specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, combined\nwith `CMD` for setting default arguments that can be overridden at runtime.\nFor more information, see ENTRYPOINT.\n\n#### Variable substitution\n\nUsing the exec form doesn't automatically invoke a command shell. This means\nthat normal shell processing, such as variable substitution, doesn't happen.\nFor example, `RUN [ \"echo\", \"$HOME\" ]` won't handle variable substitution for\n`$HOME`.\n\nIf you want shell processing then either use the shell form or execute a shell\ndirectly with the exec form, for example: `RUN [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo $HOME\" ]`.\nWhen using the exec form and executing a shell directly, as in the case for\nthe shell form, it's the shell that's doing the environment variable\nsubstitution, not the builder.\n\n#### Backslashes\n\nIn exec form, you must escape backslashes. This is particularly relevant on\nWindows where the backslash is the path separator.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command."

      "xml` and executing on the command line: `mvn\nhelp:effective-pom`\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nBesides inheriting certain top-level elements, parents have elements to\nconfigure values for child POMs and transitive dependencies. One of those\nelements is `dependencyManagement`.\n\n  * **dependencyManagement** : is used by a POM to help manage dependency information across all of its children. If the `my-parent` project uses `dependencyManagement` to define a dependency on `junit:junit:4.12`, then POMs inheriting from this one can set their dependency giving the `groupId`=`junit` and `artifactId`=`junit` only and Maven will fill in the `version` set by the parent. The benefits of this method are obvious. Dependency details can be set in one central location, which propagates to all inheriting POMs. \n\nNote that the version and scope of artifacts which are incorporated from\ntransitive dependencies are also controlled by version specifications in a\ndependency management section. This can lead to unexpected consequences.\nConsider a case in which your project uses two dependences, `dep1` and `dep2`.\n`dep2` in turn also uses `dep1`, and requires a particular minimum version to\nfunction. If you then use `dependencyManagement` to specify an older version,\n`dep2` will be forced to use the older version, and fail. So, you must be\ncareful to check the entire dependency tree to avoid this problem; `mvn\ndependency:tree` is helpful.\n\n### Aggregation (or Multi-Module)\n\nA project with modules is known as a multi-module, or aggregator project.\nModules are projects that this POM lists, and are executed as a group. A `pom`\npackaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them\nas modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of\nthose projects.",

      "Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do\nnot inherit from it.\n\n## Properties\n\nProperties are the last required piece to understand POM basics. Maven\nproperties are value placeholders, like properties in Ant. Their values are\naccessible anywhere within a POM by using the notation `${X}`, where `X` is\nthe property. Or they can be used by plugins as default values, for example:\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      ...\n      <properties>\n        <maven.compiler.source>1.7</maven.compiler.source>\n        <maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>\n        <!-- Following project.-properties are reserved for Maven in will become elements in a future POM definition. -->\n        <!-- Don't start your own properties properties with project. -->\n        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding> \n        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>\n      </properties>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nThey come in five different styles:\n\n  1. `env.X`: Prefixing a variable with \"env.\" will return the shell's environment variable. For example, `${env.PATH}` contains the PATH environment variable. \n\n_Note:_ While environment variables themselves are case-insensitive on\nWindows, lookup of properties is case-sensitive. In other words, while the\nWindows shell returns the same value for `%PATH%` and `%Path%`, Maven\ndistinguishes between `${env.PATH}` and `${env.Path}`. **The names of\nenvironment variables are normalized to all upper-case** for the sake of\nreliability.\n\n  2. `project.x`: A dot (.) notated path in the POM will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: `<project><version>1.0</version></project>` is accessible via `${project.version}`.\n  3. `settings.x`: A dot (.) notated path in the `settings.xml` will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: `<settings><offline>false</offline></settings>` is accessible via `${settings.offline}`.\n  4. Java System Properties: All properties accessible via `java.lang.System.getProperties()` are available as POM properties, such as `${java.home}`.\n  5. `x`: Set within a `<properties />` element in the POM.",
      "The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`. For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",

Now\nlet's get back to the project at hand.\n\nAfter the archetype generation of your first project you will also notice that\nthe following directory structure has been created:\n\n    \n    \n    my-app\n    |-- pom.xml\n    `-- src\n        |-- main\n        |   `-- java\n        |       `-- com\n        |           `-- mycompany\n        |               `-- app\n        |                   `-- App.java\n        `-- test\n            `-- java\n                `-- com\n                    `-- mycompany\n                        `-- app\n                            `-- AppTest.java\n\nAs you can see, the project created from the archetype has a POM, a source\ntree for your application's sources and a source tree for your test sources.\nThis is the standard layout for Maven projects (the application sources reside\nin `${project.basedir}/src/main/java` and test sources reside in\n`${project.basedir}/src/test/java`, where `${project.basedir}` represents the\ndirectory containing `pom.xml`).\n\nIf you were to create a Maven project by hand this is the directory structure\nthat we recommend using. This is a Maven convention and to learn more about it\nyou can read our [Introduction to the Standard Directory\nLayout](../introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).\n\nNow that we have a POM, some application sources, and some test sources you\nare probably asking...\n\n## How do I compile my application sources?"

      "You can view the values using `docker inspect`, and\nchange them using `docker run --env <key>=<value>`.\n\nA stage inherits any environment variables that were set using `ENV` by its\nparent stage or any ancestor. Refer\n[here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) for more on multi-\nstaged builds.\n\nEnvironment variable persistence can cause unexpected side effects. For\nexample, setting `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` changes the behavior of\n`apt-get`, and may confuse users of your image.\n\nIf an environment variable is only needed during build, and not in the final\nimage, consider setting a value for a single command instead:\n\n    \n    \n    RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...\n\nOr using `ARG`, which is not persisted in the final image:\n\n    \n    \n    ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...\n\n>  **Alternative syntax**\n>\n> The `ENV` instruction also allows an alternative syntax `ENV <key> <value>`,\n> omitting the `=`. For example:\n>  \n>  \n>     ENV MY_VAR my-value\n>\n> This syntax does not allow for multiple environment-variables to be set in a\n> single `ENV` instruction, and can be confusing. For example, the following\n> sets a single environment variable (`ONE`) with value `\"TWO= THREE=world\"`:\n>  \n>  \n>     ENV ONE TWO= THREE=world\n>\n> The alternative syntax is supported for backward compatibility, but\n> discouraged for the reasons outlined above, and may be removed in a future\n> release.\n\n## ADD\n\nADD has two forms. The latter form is required for paths containing\nwhitespace.\n\n    \n    \n    ADD [OPTIONS] <src> ... <dest>\n    ADD [OPTIONS] [\"<src>\", ... \"<dest>\"]\n\nThe available `[OPTIONS]` are:\n\n  * `--keep-git-dir`\n  * `--checksum`\n  * `--chown`\n  * `--chmod`\n  * `--link`\n  * `--exclude`\n\nThe `ADD` instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from\n`<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path `<dest>`.",
      "By default, `EXPOSE` assumes TCP. You can also specify UDP:\n\n    \n    \n    EXPOSE 80/udp\n\nTo expose on both TCP and UDP, include two lines:\n\n    \n    \n    EXPOSE 80/tcp\n    EXPOSE 80/udp\n\nIn this case, if you use `-P` with `docker run`, the port will be exposed once\nfor TCP and once for UDP. Remember that `-P` uses an ephemeral high-ordered\nhost port on the host, so TCP and UDP doesn't use the same port.\n\nRegardless of the `EXPOSE` settings, you can override them at runtime by using\nthe `-p` flag. For example\n\n    \n    \n    $ docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 80:80/udp ...\n    \n\nTo set up port redirection on the host system, see [using the -P\nflag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports).\nThe `docker network` command supports creating networks for communication\namong containers without the need to expose or publish specific ports, because\nthe containers connected to the network can communicate with each other over\nany port. For detailed information, see the [overview of this\nfeature](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/).\n\n## ENV\n\n    \n    \n    ENV <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `ENV` instruction sets the environment variable `<key>` to the value\n`<value>`. This value will be in the environment for all subsequent\ninstructions in the build stage and can be replaced inline in many as well.\nThe value will be interpreted for other environment variables, so quote\ncharacters will be removed if they are not escaped. Like command line parsing,\nquotes and backslashes can be used to include spaces within values.\n\nExample:\n\n    \n    \n    ENV MY_NAME=\"John Doe\"\n    ENV MY_DOG=Rex\\ The\\ Dog\n    ENV MY_CAT=fluffy\n\nThe `ENV` instruction allows for multiple `<key>=<value> ...` variables to be\nset at one time, and the example below will yield the same net results in the\nfinal image:\n\n    \n    \n    ENV MY_NAME=\"John Doe\" MY_DOG=Rex\\ The\\ Dog \\\n        MY_CAT=fluffy\n\nThe environment variables set using `ENV` will persist when a container is run\nfrom the resulting image.",
      "The variable expansion technique in this example allows you to pass arguments\nfrom the command line and persist them in the final image by leveraging the\n`ENV` instruction. Variable expansion is only supported for a limited set of\nDockerfile instructions.\n\n### Predefined ARGs\n\nDocker has a set of predefined `ARG` variables that you can use without a\ncorresponding `ARG` instruction in the Dockerfile.\n\n  * `HTTP_PROXY`\n  * `http_proxy`\n  * `HTTPS_PROXY`\n  * `https_proxy`\n  * `FTP_PROXY`\n  * `ftp_proxy`\n  * `NO_PROXY`\n  * `no_proxy`\n  * `ALL_PROXY`\n  * `all_proxy`\n\nTo use these, pass them on the command line using the `--build-arg` flag, for\nexample:\n\n    \n    \n    $ docker build --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=https://my-proxy.example.com .\n    \n\nBy default, these pre-defined variables are excluded from the output of\n`docker history`. Excluding them reduces the risk of accidentally leaking\nsensitive authentication information in an `HTTP_PROXY` variable.\n\nFor example, consider building the following Dockerfile using `--build-arg\nHTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxy.lon.example.com`\n\n    \n    \n    FROM ubuntu\n    RUN echo \"Hello World\"\n\nIn this case, the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` variable is not available in the\n`docker history` and is not cached. If you were to change location, and your\nproxy server changed to `http://user:pass@proxy.sfo.example.com`, a subsequent\nbuild does not result in a cache miss.\n\nIf you need to override this behaviour then you may do so by adding an `ARG`\nstatement in the Dockerfile as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    FROM ubuntu\n    ARG HTTP_PROXY\n    RUN echo \"Hello World\"\n\nWhen building this Dockerfile, the `HTTP_PROXY` is preserved in the `docker\nhistory`, and changing its value invalidates the build cache.\n\n### Automatic platform ARGs in the global scope\n\nThis feature is only available when using the\n[BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/) backend.\n\nBuildKit supports a predefined set of `ARG` variables with information on the\nplatform of the node performing the build (build platform) and on the platform\nof the resulting image (target platform). The target platform can be specified\nwith the `--platform` flag on `docker build`."

      "There are few rules that describe their co-\noperation.\n\n  1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.\n\n  2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.\n\n  3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.\n\n  4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.\n\nThe table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` /\n`CMD` combinations:\n\n| No ENTRYPOINT| ENTRYPOINT exec_entry p1_entry| ENTRYPOINT [\"exec_entry\",\n\"p1_entry\"]  \n---|---|---|---  \n **No CMD**|  error, not allowed| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry| exec_entry\np1_entry  \n **CMD [\"exec_cmd\", \"p1_cmd\"]**|  exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n **CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd**|  /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n  \n>  **Note**\n>\n> If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset\n> `CMD` to an empty value. In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the\n> current image to have a value.\n\n## VOLUME\n\n    \n    \n    VOLUME [\"/data\"]\n\nThe `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and\nmarks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other\ncontainers. The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command.",
      "For more information, see [.dockerignore\nfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).\n\n## Shell and exec form\n\nThe `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions all have two possible forms:\n\n  * `INSTRUCTION [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"]` (exec form)\n  * `INSTRUCTION command param1 param2` (shell form)\n\nThe exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to invoke\ncommands using a specific command shell, or any other executable. It uses a\nJSON array syntax, where each element in the array is a command, flag, or\nargument.\n\nThe shell form is more relaxed, and emphasizes ease of use, flexibility, and\nreadability. The shell form automatically uses a command shell, whereas the\nexec form does not.\n\n### Exec form\n\nThe exec form is parsed as a JSON array, which means that you must use double-\nquotes (\") around words, not single-quotes (').\n\n    \n    \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo hello\"]\n\nThe exec form is best used to specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, combined\nwith `CMD` for setting default arguments that can be overridden at runtime.\nFor more information, see ENTRYPOINT.\n\n#### Variable substitution\n\nUsing the exec form doesn't automatically invoke a command shell. This means\nthat normal shell processing, such as variable substitution, doesn't happen.\nFor example, `RUN [ \"echo\", \"$HOME\" ]` won't handle variable substitution for\n`$HOME`.\n\nIf you want shell processing then either use the shell form or execute a shell\ndirectly with the exec form, for example: `RUN [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo $HOME\" ]`.\nWhen using the exec form and executing a shell directly, as in the case for\nthe shell form, it's the shell that's doing the environment variable\nsubstitution, not the builder.\n\n#### Backslashes\n\nIn exec form, you must escape backslashes. This is particularly relevant on\nWindows where the backslash is the path separator."

There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files.

The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list. Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.",

There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files. You can use this to authenticate\nthe library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be\nusing already.\n\nNow that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our\npom.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n          <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nNow, when we compile the project (`mvn compile`), we'll see Maven download the\nlog4j dependency for us.\n\n## How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",

Although in build systems such as Ant inheritance can be\nsimulated, Maven makes project inheritance explicit in the project object\nmodel.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-parent</artifactId>\n      <version>2.0</version>\n      <packaging>pom</packaging>\n    </project>\n\nThe `packaging` type is required to be `pom` for _parent_ and _aggregation_\n(multi-module) projects. These types define the goals bound to a set of\nlifecycle stages. For example, if packaging is `jar`, then the `package` phase\nwill execute the `jar:jar` goal. Now we may add values to the parent POM,\nwhich will be inherited by its children. Most elements from the parent POM are\ninherited by its children, including:\n\n  * groupId\n  * version\n  * description\n  * url\n  * inceptionYear\n  * organization\n  * licenses\n  * developers\n  * contributors\n  * mailingLists\n  * scm\n  * issueManagement\n  * ciManagement\n  * properties\n  * dependencyManagement\n  * dependencies\n  * repositories\n  * pluginRepositories\n  * build \n    * plugin executions with matching ids\n    * plugin configuration\n    * etc.",

It is not required, but may be used as a\nsignifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent,\nbefore searching the local and then remote repositories.\n\nTo see inheritance in action, just have a look at the\n[ASF](https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) or\n[Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven-parent/blob/master/pom.xml) parent\nPOM's.\n\nDetailed inheritance rules are outlined in [Maven Model\nBuilder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-\nbuilder/index.html#Inheritance_Assembly). All URLs are transformed when being\ninherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin\nconfiguration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes\n`combine.children` or `combine.self` outlined in Plugins.\n\n#### The Super POM\n\nSimilar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs\nthat extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover,\njust as Java objects ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, all Project\nObject Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super\nPOM for Maven 3.5.4.\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      <modelVersion>4.0.",
      "xml` and executing on the command line: `mvn\nhelp:effective-pom`\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nBesides inheriting certain top-level elements, parents have elements to\nconfigure values for child POMs and transitive dependencies. One of those\nelements is `dependencyManagement`.\n\n  * **dependencyManagement** : is used by a POM to help manage dependency information across all of its children. If the `my-parent` project uses `dependencyManagement` to define a dependency on `junit:junit:4.12`, then POMs inheriting from this one can set their dependency giving the `groupId`=`junit` and `artifactId`=`junit` only and Maven will fill in the `version` set by the parent. The benefits of this method are obvious. Dependency details can be set in one central location, which propagates to all inheriting POMs. \n\nNote that the version and scope of artifacts which are incorporated from\ntransitive dependencies are also controlled by version specifications in a\ndependency management section. This can lead to unexpected consequences.\nConsider a case in which your project uses two dependences, `dep1` and `dep2`.\n`dep2` in turn also uses `dep1`, and requires a particular minimum version to\nfunction. If you then use `dependencyManagement` to specify an older version,\n`dep2` will be forced to use the older version, and fail. So, you must be\ncareful to check the entire dependency tree to avoid this problem; `mvn\ndependency:tree` is helpful.\n\n### Aggregation (or Multi-Module)\n\nA project with modules is known as a multi-module, or aggregator project.\nModules are projects that this POM lists, and are executed as a group. A `pom`\npackaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them\nas modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of\nthose projects."

      "By default Compose sets up\na single network for your app. Each container for a service joins the default\nnetwork and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and\ndiscoverable by the service's name. The top-level `networks` element lets you\nconfigure named networks that can be reused across multiple services.\n\nTo use a network across multiple services, you must explicitly grant each\nservice access by using the\n[networks](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/)\nattribute within the `services` top-level element. The `networks` top-level\nelement has additional syntax that provides more granular control.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic example\n\nIn the following example, at runtime, networks `front-tier` and `back-tier`\nare created and the `frontend` service is connected to `front-tier` and `back-\ntier` networks.\n\n    \n    \n    services:\n      frontend:\n        image: example/webapp\n        networks:\n          - front-tier\n          - back-tier\n    \n    networks:\n      front-tier:\n      back-tier:\n\n### Advanced example\n\n    \n    \n    services:\n      proxy:\n        build: ./proxy\n        networks:\n          - frontend\n      app:\n        build: ./app\n        networks:\n          - frontend\n          - backend\n      db:\n        image: postgres\n        networks:\n          - backend\n    \n    networks:\n      frontend:\n        # Use a custom driver\n        driver: custom-driver-1\n      backend:\n        # Use a custom driver which takes special options\n        driver: custom-driver-2\n        driver_opts:\n          foo: \"1\"\n          bar: \"2\"\n\nThe advanced example shows a Compose file which defines two custom networks.\nThe `proxy` service is isolated from the `db` service, because they do not\nshare a network in common. Only `app` can talk to both.\n\n## Attributes\n\n### driver\n\n`driver` specifies which driver should be used for this network. Compose\nreturns an error if the driver is not available on the platform.\n\n    \n    \n    networks:\n      db-data:\n        driver: bridge\n\nFor more information on drivers and available options, see [Network\ndrivers](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/).\n\n### driver_opts\n\n`driver_opts` specifies a list of options as key-value pairs to pass to the\ndriver. These options are driver-dependent. Consult the driver's documentation\nfor more information.",

When no specific\nnetwork configuration is set, any service is able to reach any other service\nat that service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name on the `default` network. If services do declare\nnetworks they are attached to, `links` does not override the network\nconfiguration and services not attached to a shared network are not be able to\ncommunicate. Compose doesn't warn you about a configuration mismatch.\n\nLinks also express implicit dependency between services in the same way as\ndepends_on, so they determine the order of service startup.\n\n## logging\n\n`logging` defines the logging configuration for the service.\n\n    \n    \n    logging:\n      driver: syslog\n      options:\n        syslog-address: \"tcp://192.168.0.42:123\"\n\nThe `driver` name specifies a logging driver for the service's containers. The\ndefault and available values are platform specific. Driver specific options\ncan be set with `options` as key-value pairs.\n\n## mac_address\n\n> Available with Docker Compose version 2.24.0 and later.\n\n`mac_address` sets a MAC address for the service container.\n\n>  **Note** Container runtimes might reject this value (ie. Docker Engine >=\n> v25.0). In that case, you should use networks.mac_address instead.\n\n## mem_limit\n\n`mem_limit` configures a limit on the amount of memory a container can\nallocate, set as a string expressing a [byte\nvalue](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/11-extension/#specifying-\nbyte-values).\n\nWhen set, `mem_limit` must be consistent with the `limits.memory` attribute in\nthe [Deploy Specification](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-\nfile/deploy/#memory).\n\n## mem_reservation\n\n`mem_reservation` configures a reservation on the amount of memory a container\ncan allocate, set as a string expressing a [byte\nvalue](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/11-extension/#specifying-\nbyte-values).\n\nWhen set, `mem_reservation` must be consistent with the `reservations.memory`\nattribute in the [Deploy\nSpecification](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/deploy/#memory).\n\n## mem_swappiness\n\n`mem_swappiness` defines as a percentage, a value between 0 and 100, for the\nhost kernel to swap out anonymous memory pages used by a container.",
      "### priority\n\n`priority` indicates in which order Compose connects the service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncontainers to its networks. If unspecified, the default value is 0.\n\nIn the following example, the app service connects to `app_net_1` first as it\nhas the highest priority. It then connects to `app_net_3`, then `app_net_2`,\nwhich uses the default priority value of 0.\n\n    \n    \n    services:\n      app:\n        image: busybox\n        command: top\n        networks:\n          app_net_1:\n            priority: 1000\n          app_net_2:\n    \n          app_net_3:\n            priority: 100\n    networks:\n      app_net_1:\n      app_net_2:\n      app_net_3:\n\n## oom_kill_disable\n\nIf `oom_kill_disable` is set, Compose configures the platform so it won't kill\nthe container in case of memory starvation.\n\n## oom_score_adj\n\n`oom_score_adj` tunes the preference for containers to be killed by platform\nin case of memory starvation. Value must be within -1000,1000 range.\n\n## pid\n\n`pid` sets the PID mode for container created by Compose. Supported values are\nplatform specific.\n\n## pids_limit\n\n`pids_limit` tunes a container\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PIDs limit. Set to -1 for unlimited PIDs.\n\n    \n    \n    pids_limit: 10\n\nWhen set, `pids_limit` must be consistent with the `pids` attribute in the\n[Deploy Specification](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-\nfile/deploy/#pids).\n\n## platform\n\n`platform` defines the target platform the containers for the service run on.\nIt uses the `os[/arch[/variant]]` syntax.\n\nThe values of `os`, `arch`, and `variant` must conform to the convention used\nby the [OCI Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-\nspec/blob/v1.0.2/image-index.md).\n\nCompose uses this attribute to determine which version of the image is pulled\nand/or on which platform the service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build is performed.\n\n    \n    \n    platform: darwin\n    platform: windows/amd64\n    platform: linux/arm64/v8\n\n## ports\n\nThe `ports` is used to define the port mappings between the host machine and\nthe containers."

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency.

      "xml` and executing on the command line: `mvn\nhelp:effective-pom`\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nBesides inheriting certain top-level elements, parents have elements to\nconfigure values for child POMs and transitive dependencies. One of those\nelements is `dependencyManagement`.\n\n  * **dependencyManagement** : is used by a POM to help manage dependency information across all of its children. If the `my-parent` project uses `dependencyManagement` to define a dependency on `junit:junit:4.12`, then POMs inheriting from this one can set their dependency giving the `groupId`=`junit` and `artifactId`=`junit` only and Maven will fill in the `version` set by the parent. The benefits of this method are obvious. Dependency details can be set in one central location, which propagates to all inheriting POMs. \n\nNote that the version and scope of artifacts which are incorporated from\ntransitive dependencies are also controlled by version specifications in a\ndependency management section. This can lead to unexpected consequences.\nConsider a case in which your project uses two dependences, `dep1` and `dep2`.\n`dep2` in turn also uses `dep1`, and requires a particular minimum version to\nfunction. If you then use `dependencyManagement` to specify an older version,\n`dep2` will be forced to use the older version, and fail. So, you must be\ncareful to check the entire dependency tree to avoid this problem; `mvn\ndependency:tree` is helpful.\n\n### Aggregation (or Multi-Module)\n\nA project with modules is known as a multi-module, or aggregator project.\nModules are projects that this POM lists, and are executed as a group. A `pom`\npackaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them\nas modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of\nthose projects."

The compiler source option specifies the version of the Java language to use for compiling the code, while the compiler target option specifies the version of the Java language to generate bytecode for.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude that there is no direct dependency between the two configuration options.

The compiler source option specifies the version of the Java language to use, while the compiler target option specifies the version of the Java language to generate bytecode for. There is no direct dependency between these two configuration options.\n\nMy uncertainty level for this conclusion is 9 out of 10, as I am confident that there is no direct dependency between the two configuration options based on my analysis of the Maven documentation and pom.xml file.\n\nThe answer to whether a dependency exists is: False.\" }",

      "Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do\nnot inherit from it.\n\n## Properties\n\nProperties are the last required piece to understand POM basics. Maven\nproperties are value placeholders, like properties in Ant. Their values are\naccessible anywhere within a POM by using the notation `${X}`, where `X` is\nthe property. Or they can be used by plugins as default values, for example:\n\n    \n    \n    <project>\n      ...\n      <properties>\n        <maven.compiler.source>1.7</maven.compiler.source>\n        <maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>\n        <!-- Following project.-properties are reserved for Maven in will become elements in a future POM definition. -->\n        <!-- Don't start your own properties properties with project. -->\n        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding> \n        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>\n      </properties>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nThey come in five different styles:\n\n  1. `env.X`: Prefixing a variable with \"env.\" will return the shell's environment variable. For example, `${env.PATH}` contains the PATH environment variable. \n\n_Note:_ While environment variables themselves are case-insensitive on\nWindows, lookup of properties is case-sensitive. In other words, while the\nWindows shell returns the same value for `%PATH%` and `%Path%`, Maven\ndistinguishes between `${env.PATH}` and `${env.Path}`. **The names of\nenvironment variables are normalized to all upper-case** for the sake of\nreliability.\n\n  2. `project.x`: A dot (.) notated path in the POM will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: `<project><version>1.0</version></project>` is accessible via `${project.version}`.\n  3. `settings.x`: A dot (.) notated path in the `settings.xml` will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: `<settings><offline>false</offline></settings>` is accessible via `${settings.offline}`.\n  4. Java System Properties: All properties accessible via `java.lang.System.getProperties()` are available as POM properties, such as `${java.home}`.\n  5. `x`: Set within a `<properties />` element in the POM.",
      "The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`. For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

      "There are few rules that describe their co-\noperation.\n\n  1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.\n\n  2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.\n\n  3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.\n\n  4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.\n\nThe table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` /\n`CMD` combinations:\n\n| No ENTRYPOINT| ENTRYPOINT exec_entry p1_entry| ENTRYPOINT [\"exec_entry\",\n\"p1_entry\"]  \n---|---|---|---  \n **No CMD**|  error, not allowed| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry| exec_entry\np1_entry  \n **CMD [\"exec_cmd\", \"p1_cmd\"]**|  exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n **CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd**|  /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n  \n>  **Note**\n>\n> If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset\n> `CMD` to an empty value. In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the\n> current image to have a value.\n\n## VOLUME\n\n    \n    \n    VOLUME [\"/data\"]\n\nThe `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and\nmarks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other\ncontainers. The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command.",
      "You can view the values using `docker inspect`, and\nchange them using `docker run --env <key>=<value>`.\n\nA stage inherits any environment variables that were set using `ENV` by its\nparent stage or any ancestor. Refer\n[here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) for more on multi-\nstaged builds.\n\nEnvironment variable persistence can cause unexpected side effects. For\nexample, setting `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` changes the behavior of\n`apt-get`, and may confuse users of your image.\n\nIf an environment variable is only needed during build, and not in the final\nimage, consider setting a value for a single command instead:\n\n    \n    \n    RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...\n\nOr using `ARG`, which is not persisted in the final image:\n\n    \n    \n    ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...\n\n>  **Alternative syntax**\n>\n> The `ENV` instruction also allows an alternative syntax `ENV <key> <value>`,\n> omitting the `=`. For example:\n>  \n>  \n>     ENV MY_VAR my-value\n>\n> This syntax does not allow for multiple environment-variables to be set in a\n> single `ENV` instruction, and can be confusing. For example, the following\n> sets a single environment variable (`ONE`) with value `\"TWO= THREE=world\"`:\n>  \n>  \n>     ENV ONE TWO= THREE=world\n>\n> The alternative syntax is supported for backward compatibility, but\n> discouraged for the reasons outlined above, and may be removed in a future\n> release.\n\n## ADD\n\nADD has two forms. The latter form is required for paths containing\nwhitespace.\n\n    \n    \n    ADD [OPTIONS] <src> ... <dest>\n    ADD [OPTIONS] [\"<src>\", ... \"<dest>\"]\n\nThe available `[OPTIONS]` are:\n\n  * `--keep-git-dir`\n  * `--checksum`\n  * `--chown`\n  * `--chmod`\n  * `--link`\n  * `--exclude`\n\nThe `ADD` instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from\n`<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path `<dest>`."

The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml.

We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow.

Remember that `-P` uses an ephemeral high-ordered\nhost port on the host, so TCP and UDP doesn't use the same port.\n\nRegardless of the `EXPOSE` settings, you can override them at runtime by using\nthe `-p` flag.

If a\nDockerfile defines an `ARG` variable whose value is different from a previous\nbuild, then a \"cache miss\" occurs upon its first usage, not its definition. In\nparticular, all `RUN` instructions following an `ARG` instruction use the\n`ARG` variable implicitly (as an environment variable), thus can cause a cache\nmiss. All predefined `ARG` variables are exempt from caching unless there is a\nmatching `ARG` statement in the Dockerfile.\n\nFor example, consider these two Dockerfile:\n\n    \n    \n    FROM ubuntu\n    ARG CONT_IMG_VER\n    RUN echo $CONT_IMG_VER\n    \n    \n    FROM ubuntu\n    ARG CONT_IMG_VER\n    RUN echo hello\n\nIf you specify `--build-arg CONT_IMG_VER=<value>` on the command line, in both\ncases, the specification on line 2 doesn't cause a cache miss; line 3 does\ncause a cache miss. `ARG CONT_IMG_VER` causes the `RUN` line to be identified\nas the same as running `CONT_IMG_VER=<value> echo hello`, so if the `<value>`\nchanges, you get a cache miss.\n\nConsider another example under the same command line:\n\n    \n    \n    FROM ubuntu\n    ARG CONT_IMG_VER\n    ENV CONT_IMG_VER=$CONT_IMG_VER\n    RUN echo $CONT_IMG_VER\n\nIn this example, the cache miss occurs on line 3. The miss happens because the\nvariable's value in the `ENV` references the `ARG` variable and that variable\nis changed through the command line."

      "For example, by configuring the\n`maven-antrun-plugin`, one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is\nultimately a declaration, however. Whereas a `build.xml` tells Ant precisely\nwhat to do when it is run (procedural), a POM states its configuration\n(declarative).

For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId `org.apache.maven`. Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system.

For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

The shell form automatically uses a command shell, whereas the\nexec form does not.\n\n### Exec form\n\nThe exec form is parsed as a JSON array, which means that you must use double-\nquotes (\") around words, not single-quotes (').\n\n    \n    \n    ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"echo hello\"]\n\nThe exec form is best used to specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, combined\nwith `CMD` for setting default arguments that can be overridden at runtime.\nFor more information, see ENTRYPOINT.\n\n#### Variable substitution\n\nUsing the exec form doesn't automatically invoke a command shell. This means\nthat normal shell processing, such as variable substitution, doesn't happen.\nFor example, `RUN [ \"echo\", \"$HOME\" ]` won't handle variable substitution for\n`$HOME`.\n\nIf you want shell processing then either use the shell form or execute a shell\ndirectly with the exec form, for example: `RUN [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo $HOME\" ]`.\nWhen using the exec form and executing a shell directly, as in the case for\nthe shell form, it's the shell that's doing the environment variable\nsubstitution, not the builder.\n\n#### Backslashes\n\nIn exec form, you must escape backslashes. This is particularly relevant on\nWindows where the backslash is the path separator.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command."

The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>. You can also set up your own remote\nrepository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or\nin addition to the default remote repository. For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library.",
