      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

For example, version\n**1.0-SNAPSHOT** is released as version **1.0** , and the new development\nversion is version **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.\n\n## How do I use plugins?\n\nWhenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by\nadding or reconfiguring plugins.\n\nFor this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0\nsources.

This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>. You can also set up your own remote\nrepository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or\nin addition to the default remote repository. For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we\ncan see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library."

For example, version\n**1.0-SNAPSHOT** is released as version **1.0** , and the new development\nversion is version **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.\n\n## How do I use plugins?\n\nWhenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by\nadding or reconfiguring plugins.\n\nFor this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0\nsources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM:\n\n    \n    \n    ...\n    <build>\n      <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n          <version>3.3</version>\n          <configuration>\n            <source>1.5</source>\n            <target>1.5</target>\n          </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n      </plugins>\n    </build>\n    ...\n\nYou'll notice that all plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in\nsome ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",

However, it is possible\nto write a `SpEL` expression in `@Value`.

For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",
      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`."

Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system.

See the\n\"[Production ready features](../actuator/endpoints.html)\" section for details.  \n---|---  \n  \n### @ConfigurationProperties vs. @Value\n\nThe `@Value` annotation is a core container feature, and it does not provide\nthe same features as type-safe configuration properties. The following table\nsummarizes the features that are supported by `@ConfigurationProperties` and\n`@Value`:\n\nFeature | `@ConfigurationProperties` | `@Value`  \n---|---|---  \n  \nRelaxed binding\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nLimited (see note below)  \n  \n[Meta-data support](../../specification/configuration-metadata/index.html)\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n`SpEL` evaluation\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n__ |\n\nIf you do want to use `@Value`, we recommend that you refer to property names\nusing their canonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters). This\nwill allow Spring Boot to use the same logic as it does when relaxed binding\n`@ConfigurationProperties`.\n\nFor example, `@Value(\"${demo.item-price}\")` will pick up `demo.item-price` and\n`demo.itemPrice` forms from the `application.properties` file, as well as\n`DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment. If you used\n`@Value(\"${demo.itemPrice}\")` instead, `demo.item-price` and `DEMO_ITEMPRICE`\nwould not be considered.  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nIf you define a set of configuration keys for your own components, we\nrecommend you group them in a POJO annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`.\nDoing so will provide you with structured, type-safe object that you can\ninject into your own beans.\n\n`SpEL` expressions from application property files are not processed at time\nof parsing these files and populating the environment. However, it is possible\nto write a `SpEL` expression in `@Value`. If the value of a property from an\napplication property file is a `SpEL` expression, it will be evaluated when\nconsumed through `@Value`.\n\n[SpringApplication](spring-application.html) [Profiles](profiles.",

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever).

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these,\nwhich contains an MD5 hash for these files.

      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",
      "The release process also increments\nthe development version to **x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT**. For example, version\n**1.0-SNAPSHOT** is released as version **1.0** , and the new development\nversion is version **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.\n\n## How do I use plugins?\n\nWhenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by\nadding or reconfiguring plugins.\n\nFor this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0\nsources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM:\n\n    \n    \n    ...\n    <build>\n      <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n          <version>3.3</version>\n          <configuration>\n            <source>1.5</source>\n            <target>1.5</target>\n          </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n      </plugins>\n    </build>\n    ...\n\nYou'll notice that all plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in\nsome ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope.

      "In our case, the example POM for `org.codehaus.mojo:my-\nproject:1.0` defined above will be packaged as a `jar`.

The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`.

It can be defined using short syntax for simple\nport mapping or long syntax, which includes additional options like protocol\ntype and network mode.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Port mapping must not be used with `network_mode: host` otherwise a runtime\n> error occurs.\n\n### Short syntax\n\nThe short syntax is a colon-separated string to set the host IP, host port,\nand container port in the form:\n\n`[HOST:]CONTAINER[/PROTOCOL]` where:\n\n  * `HOST` is `[IP:](port | range)`\n  * `CONTAINER` is `port | range`\n  * `PROTOCOL` to restrict port to specified protocol. `tcp` and `udp` values are defined by the Specification, Compose offers support for platform-specific protocol names.\n\nIf host IP is not set, it binds to all network interfaces. Ports can be either\na single value or a range. Host and container must use equivalent ranges.\n\nEither specify both ports (`HOST:CONTAINER`), or just the container port. In\nthe latter case, the container runtime automatically allocates any unassigned\nport of the host.\n\n`HOST:CONTAINER` should always be specified as a (quoted) string, to avoid\nconflicts with [yaml base-60 float](https://yaml.org/type/float.html).\n\nExamples:\n\n    \n    \n    ports:\n      - \"3000\"\n      - \"3000-3005\"\n      - \"8000:8000\"\n      - \"9090-9091:8080-8081\"\n      - \"49100:22\"\n      - \"8000-9000:80\"\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8001:8001\"\n      - \"127.0.0.1:5000-5010:5000-5010\"\n      - \"6060:6060/udp\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> If Host IP mapping is not supported by a container engine, Compose rejects\n> the Compose file and ignores the specified host IP.\n\n### Long syntax\n\nThe long form syntax allows the configuration of additional fields that can't\nbe expressed in the short form.",

For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",

This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used -\nincluding a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the\nlatest available).\n\nThe `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from\nthe compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as\npart of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also\npossible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For\ninformation on this, see the [ Introduction to the Build\nLifecycle](../introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).\n\nTo find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the [\nPlugins List](../../plugins/) and navigate to the plugin and goal you are\nusing. For general information about how to configure the available parameters\nof a plugin, have a look at the [Guide to Configuring Plugins](../mini/guide-\nconfiguring-plugins.html).\n\n## How do I add resources to my JAR?\n\nAnother common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the\nPOM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file."

When a Docker swarm\nservice is granted access to a secret, the secret gets mounted into the\ncontainer. For example, if a secret named `db.password` is mounted at location\n`/run/secrets/`, you can make `db.password` available to the Spring\nenvironment using the following:\n\n  * Properties\n\n  * YAML\n\n    \n    \n    spring.config.import=optional:configtree:/run/secrets/\n    \n    \n    spring:\n      config:\n        import: \"optional:configtree:/run/secrets/\"\n\n### Property Placeholders\n\nThe values in `application.properties` and `application.yaml` are filtered\nthrough the existing `Environment` when they are used, so you can refer back\nto previously defined values (for example, from System properties or\nenvironment variables). The standard `${name}` property-placeholder syntax can\nbe used anywhere within a value. Property placeholders can also specify a\ndefault value using a `:` to separate the default value from the property\nname, for example `${name:default}`.\n\nThe use of placeholders with and without defaults is shown in the following\nexample:\n\n  * Properties\n\n  * YAML\n\n    \n    \n    app.name=MyApp\n    app.description=${app.name} is a Spring Boot application written by ${username:Unknown}\n    \n    \n    app:\n      name: \"MyApp\"\n      description: \"${app.name} is a Spring Boot application written by ${username:Unknown}\"\n\nAssuming that the `username` property has not been set elsewhere,\n`app.description` will have the value `MyApp is a Spring Boot application\nwritten by Unknown`.\n\n__ |\n\nYou should always refer to property names in the placeholder using their\ncanonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters). This will allow\nSpring Boot to use the same logic as it does when relaxed binding\n`@ConfigurationProperties`.\n\nFor example, `${demo.item-price}` will pick up `demo.item-price` and\n`demo.itemPrice` forms from the `application.properties` file, as well as\n`DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment.

      "apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>pom</packaging>\n    \n      <modules>\n        <module>my-app</module>\n        <module>my-webapp</module>\n      </modules>\n    </project>\n\nWe'll need a dependency on the JAR from the webapp, so add this to `my-\nwebapp/pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n      .\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n        </dependency>\n        .\n      </dependencies>\n\nFinally, add the following `<parent>` element to both of the other `pom.xml`\nfiles in the subdirectories:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <parent>\n        <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n        <artifactId>app</artifactId>\n        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      </parent>\n      .\n\nNow, try it. from the top level directory, run:\n\n    \n    \n    mvn verify\n\nThe WAR has now been created in `my-webapp/target/my-webapp.war`, and the JAR\nis included:\n\n    \n    \n    $ jar tvf my-webapp/target/my-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT."
