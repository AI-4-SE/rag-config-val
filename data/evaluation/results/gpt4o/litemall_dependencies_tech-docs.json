You can override\nthe `ENTRYPOINT` instruction using the `docker run --entrypoint` flag.\n\nThe shell form of `ENTRYPOINT` prevents any `CMD` command line arguments from\nbeing used.",
      "There are few rules that describe their co-\noperation.\n\n  1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.\n\n  2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.\n\n  3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.\n\n  4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.\n\nThe table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` /\n`CMD` combinations:\n\n| No ENTRYPOINT| ENTRYPOINT exec_entry p1_entry| ENTRYPOINT [\"exec_entry\",\n\"p1_entry\"]  \n---|---|---|---  \n **No CMD**|  error, not allowed| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry| exec_entry\np1_entry  \n **CMD [\"exec_cmd\", \"p1_cmd\"]**|  exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n **CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd**|  /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd| /bin/sh -c exec_entry\np1_entry| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd  \n  \n>  **Note**\n>\n> If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset\n> `CMD` to an empty value.

The value can be a JSON array, `VOLUME [\"/var/log/\"]`, or a plain\nstring with multiple arguments, such as `VOLUME /var/log` or `VOLUME /var/log\n/var/db`. For more information/examples and mounting instructions via the\nDocker client, refer to [_Share Directories via\nVolumes_](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) documentation.\n\nThe `docker run` command initializes the newly created volume with any data\nthat exists at the specified location within the base image.",
      "See\n`ENTRYPOINT`. If the user specifies arguments to `docker run` then they will\noverride the default specified in `CMD`, but still use the default\n`ENTRYPOINT`.\n\nIf `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`\ninstruction, both the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions should be specified\nin the exec form.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Don't confuse `RUN` with `CMD`. `RUN` actually runs a command and commits\n> the result; `CMD` doesn't execute anything at build time, but specifies the\n> intended command for the image.\n\n## LABEL\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...\n\nThe `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value\npair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as\nyou would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL \"com.example.vendor\"=\"ACME Incorporated\"\n    LABEL com.example.label-with-value=\"foo\"\n    LABEL version=\"1.0\"\n    LABEL description=\"This text illustrates \\\n    that label-values can span multiple lines.\"\n\nAn image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a\nsingle line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,\nbut this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple\nlabels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:\n\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" multi.label2=\"value2\" other=\"value3\"\n    \n    \n    LABEL multi.label1=\"value1\" \\\n          multi.label2=\"value2\" \\\n          other=\"value3\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> Be sure to use double quotes and not single quotes. Particularly when you\n> are using string interpolation (e.g. `LABEL example=\"foo-$ENV_VAR\"`), single\n> quotes will take the string as is without unpacking the variable's value.\n\nLabels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are\ninherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,\nthe most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.\n\nTo view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command."

Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

For\nexample, imagine a project `A` that depends upon project `B` to compile a\nportion of code that may not be used at runtime, then we may have no need for\nproject `B` for all project. So if project `X` adds project `A` as its own\ndependency, then Maven does not need to install project `B` at all.\nSymbolically, if `=>` represents a required dependency, and `-->` represents\noptional, although `A=>B` may be the case when building A `X=>A-->B` would be\nthe case when building `X`.\n\nIn the shortest terms, `optional` lets other projects know that, when you use\nthis project, you do not require this dependency in order to work correctly.\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nDependencies can be managed in the `dependencyManagement` section to affect\nthe resolution of dependencies which are not fully qualified or to enforce the\nusage of a specific transitive dependency version. Further information in\n[Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism](./guides/introduction/introduction-\nto-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\n#### Dependency Version Requirement Specification\n\nDependencies' `version` elements define version requirements, which are used\nto compute dependency versions. Soft requirements can be replaced by different\nversions of the same artifact found elsewhere in the dependency graph. Hard\nrequirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft\nrequirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the\nhard requirements for that artifact, the build fails.\n\nVersion requirements have the following syntax:\n\n  * `1.0`: Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.\n  * `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.",

You would get an `execution` like this:\n\n    \n        <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <build>\n        <plugins>\n          <plugin>\n            <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>1.1</version>\n            <executions>\n              <execution>\n                <id>echodir</id>\n                <goals>\n                  <goal>run</goal>\n                </goals>\n                <phase>verify</phase>\n                <inherited>false</inherited>\n                <configuration>\n                  <tasks>\n                    <echo>Build Dir: /home/jenkins/82467a7c/workspace/aven_maven-box_maven-site_master/target</echo>\n                  </tasks>\n                </configuration>\n              </execution>\n            </executions>\n    \n          </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n      </build>\n    </project>\n\n    * **id** : Self explanatory.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin.

The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under.

See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals.

In the above example, we are setting the classifier property to test in the `maven-jar-plugin`'s Mojo. It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin.

The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under.

See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals.

Hard\nrequirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft\nrequirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the\nhard requirements for that artifact, the build fails.\n\nVersion requirements have the following syntax:\n\n  * `1.0`: Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.\n  * `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.",

      "mvn process-resources \"-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again\"\n\n## How do I use external dependencies?\n\nYou've probably already noticed a `dependencies` element in the POM we've been\nusing as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`."

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

      "If not, Maven fails the build and suggests that you download and\ninstall it manually.\n\n  * **optional** :  \nMarks a dependency optional when this project itself is a dependency. For\nexample, imagine a project `A` that depends upon project `B` to compile a\nportion of code that may not be used at runtime, then we may have no need for\nproject `B` for all project. So if project `X` adds project `A` as its own\ndependency, then Maven does not need to install project `B` at all.\nSymbolically, if `=>` represents a required dependency, and `-->` represents\noptional, although `A=>B` may be the case when building A `X=>A-->B` would be\nthe case when building `X`.\n\nIn the shortest terms, `optional` lets other projects know that, when you use\nthis project, you do not require this dependency in order to work correctly.\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nDependencies can be managed in the `dependencyManagement` section to affect\nthe resolution of dependencies which are not fully qualified or to enforce the\nusage of a specific transitive dependency version. Further information in\n[Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism](./guides/introduction/introduction-\nto-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\n#### Dependency Version Requirement Specification\n\nDependencies' `version` elements define version requirements, which are used\nto compute dependency versions. Soft requirements can be replaced by different\nversions of the same artifact found elsewhere in the dependency graph. Hard\nrequirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft\nrequirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the\nhard requirements for that artifact, the build fails.\n\nVersion requirements have the following syntax:\n\n  * `1.0`: Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.\n  * `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive."

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "* If Compose is executed with `coverage_lib` as the explicit service to run, the service `coverage_lib` and the profile `test` are active and `test_lib` is pulled in by the `depends_on` constraint.\n  * If Compose is executed with `debug_lib` as the explicit service to run, again the model is invalid regarding the `depends_on` constraint of `debug_lib`, since `debug_lib` and `test_lib` have no common `profiles` listed.\n  * If Compose is executed with `debug_lib` as the explicit service to run and profile `test` is enabled, profile `debug` is automatically enabled and service `test_lib` is pulled in as a dependency starting both services `debug_lib` and `test_lib`.\n\nSee how you can use `profiles` in [Docker\nCompose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/).\n\n[Edit this\npage](https://github.com/docker/docs/edit/main/content/compose/compose-\nfile/15-profiles.md)\n\n[Request\nchanges](https://github.com/docker/docs/issues/new?template=doc_issue.yml&location=https%3a%2f%2fdocs.docker.com%2fcompose%2fcompose-\nfile%2f15-profiles%2f&labels=status%2Ftriage)\n\nTable of contents\n\n  * Illustrative example\n\n[Product offerings](https://www.docker.com/)\n[Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/) [About\nus](https://www.docker.com/company/)\n[Support](https://www.docker.com/support/)\n[Contribute](https://github.com/docker/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n* * *\n\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013-2024 Docker Inc.

      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>. You can also set up your own remote\nrepository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or\nin addition to the default remote repository. For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever).

The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`."

You can use this to authenticate\nthe library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be\nusing already.\n\nNow that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our\npom.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n          <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nNow, when we compile the project (`mvn compile`), we'll see Maven download the\nlog4j dependency for us.\n\n## How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?",

      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often.

The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

      "By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.

For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

      "If not, Maven fails the build and suggests that you download and\ninstall it manually.\n\n  * **optional** :  \nMarks a dependency optional when this project itself is a dependency. For\nexample, imagine a project `A` that depends upon project `B` to compile a\nportion of code that may not be used at runtime, then we may have no need for\nproject `B` for all project. So if project `X` adds project `A` as its own\ndependency, then Maven does not need to install project `B` at all.\nSymbolically, if `=>` represents a required dependency, and `-->` represents\noptional, although `A=>B` may be the case when building A `X=>A-->B` would be\nthe case when building `X`.\n\nIn the shortest terms, `optional` lets other projects know that, when you use\nthis project, you do not require this dependency in order to work correctly.\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nDependencies can be managed in the `dependencyManagement` section to affect\nthe resolution of dependencies which are not fully qualified or to enforce the\nusage of a specific transitive dependency version. Further information in\n[Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism](./guides/introduction/introduction-\nto-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\n#### Dependency Version Requirement Specification\n\nDependencies' `version` elements define version requirements, which are used\nto compute dependency versions. Soft requirements can be replaced by different\nversions of the same artifact found elsewhere in the dependency graph. Hard\nrequirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft\nrequirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the\nhard requirements for that artifact, the build fails.\n\nVersion requirements have the following syntax:\n\n  * `1.0`: Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree.\n  * `[1.0]`: Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.\n  * `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.",

The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository.

In the above example, we are setting the classifier property to test in the `maven-jar-plugin`'s Mojo. It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin. In other words: values within a `configuration` element are never explicitly required by the POM schema, but a plugin goal has every right to require configuration values.",
      "The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via `exclusions`, or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

It is by default false. Extensions are covered later in this document.\n  * **inherited** : `true` or `false`, whether or not this plugin configuration should apply to POMs which inherit from this one. Default value is `true`.\n  * **configuration** : This is specific to the individual plugin. Without going too in depth into the mechanics of how plugins work, suffice it to say that whatever properties that the plugin Mojo may expect (these are getters and setters in the Java Mojo bean) can be specified here. In the above example, we are setting the classifier property to test in the `maven-jar-plugin`'s Mojo. It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin. In other words: values within a `configuration` element are never explicitly required by the POM schema, but a plugin goal has every right to require configuration values.",
      "The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via `exclusions`, or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. `executions` configure the `execution` of a plugin's goals. \n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to bind the `antrun:run` goal to the `verify`\nphase.

For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",
      "The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via `exclusions`, or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. `executions` configure the `execution` of a plugin's goals. \n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to bind the `antrun:run` goal to the `verify`\nphase.

It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin.

The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under.

See above under **Dependencies** for more information.\n  * **executions** : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. `executions` configure the `execution` of a plugin's goals. \n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to bind the `antrun:run` goal to the `verify`\nphase.

For more information on\nrepositories you can refer to the [Introduction to\nRepositories](../introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).\n\nLet's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some\nlogging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to\nknow what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. The appropriate\ndirectory on Maven Central is called\n[/maven2/log4j/log4j](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/). In\nthat directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-\nmetadata.xml for log4j looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    <metadata>\n      <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n      <version>1.1.3</version>\n      <versioning>\n        <versions>\n          <version>1.1.3</version>\n          <version>1.2.4</version>\n          <version>1.2.5</version>\n          <version>1.2.6</version>\n          <version>1.2.7</version>\n          <version>1.2.8</version>\n          <version>1.2.11</version>\n          <version>1.2.9</version>\n          <version>1.2.12</version>\n        </versions>\n      </versioning>\n    </metadata>\n\nFrom this file, we can see that the groupId we want is \"log4j\" and the\nartifactId is \"log4j\". We see lots of different version values to choose from;\nfor now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml\nfiles may also specify which version is the current release version: see\n[repository metadata reference](/ref/current/maven-repository-\nmetadata/repository-metadata.html)).

This applies to an explicit restart controlled by a Compose operation, and excludes automated restart by the container runtime after the container dies.

If it's not defined the default value of `required` is `true`. Introduced in Docker Compose version [2.20.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2200).\n\nService dependencies cause the following behaviors:\n\n  * Compose creates services in dependency order.

In the following example, `db` is expected to be \"healthy\" before `web` is created.\n\n  * Compose removes services in dependency order.

A\nservice is an abstract concept implemented on platforms by running the same\ncontainer image, and configuration, one or more times.\n\nServices communicate with each other through\n[networks](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/06-networks/).

The\nSpecification describes such a persistent data as a high-level filesystem\nmount with global options.\n\nSome services require configuration data that is dependent on the runtime or\nplatform. For this, the Specification defines a dedicated\n[configs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/08-configs/) concept.\nFrom a service container point of view, configs are comparable to volumes, in\nthat they are files mounted into the container.
