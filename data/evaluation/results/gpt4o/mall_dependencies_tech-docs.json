You will most likely want to customize\nyour Maven site but if you're pressed for time all you need to do to provide\nbasic information about your project is execute the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    mvn site\n\nThere are plenty of other standalone goals that can be executed as well, for\nexample:\n\n    \n    \n    mvn clean\n\nThis will remove the `target` directory with all the build data before\nstarting so that it is fresh.\n\n## What is a SNAPSHOT version?\n\nNotice the value of the **version** tag in the `pom.xml` file shown below has\nthe suffix: `-SNAPSHOT`.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n      ...\n      <groupId>...</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      ...\n\nThe `SNAPSHOT` value refers to the 'latest' code along a development branch,\nand provides no guarantee the code is stable or unchanging. Conversely, the\ncode in a 'release' version (any version value without the suffix `SNAPSHOT`)\nis unchanging.\n\nIn other words, a SNAPSHOT version is the 'development' version before the\nfinal 'release' version. The SNAPSHOT is \"older\" than its release.\n\nDuring the [release](../../plugins/maven-release-plugin/) process, a version\nof **x.y-SNAPSHOT** changes to **x.y**. The release process also increments\nthe development version to **x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT**.",

For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope.

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency,\nand can be values like `compile`, `test`, and `runtime`.",

      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin.",
      "For example, by configuring the\n`maven-antrun-plugin`, one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is\nultimately a declaration, however. Whereas a `build.xml` tells Ant precisely\nwhat to do when it is run (procedural), a POM states its configuration\n(declarative). If some external force causes the lifecycle to skip the Ant\nplugin execution, it does not stop the plugins that are executed from doing\ntheir magic. This is unlike a `build.xml` file, where tasks are almost always\ndependant on the lines executed before it.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0</version>\n    </project>\n\n## Maven Coordinates\n\nThe POM defined above is the bare minimum that Maven allows.\n`groupId:artifactId:version` are all required fields (although, groupId and\nversion do not need to be explicitly defined if they are inherited from a\nparent - more on inheritance later). The three fields act much like an address\nand timestamp in one. This marks a specific place in a repository, acting like\na coordinate system for Maven projects:\n\n  * **groupId** : This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId `org.apache.maven`. Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository."

The source of the\nconfig is either `file` or `external`.\n\n  * `file`: The config is created with the contents of the file at the specified path.\n  * `environment`: The config content is created with the value of an environment variable.

For this, the Specification defines a dedicated\n[configs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/08-configs/) concept.\nFrom a service container point of view, configs are comparable to volumes, in\nthat they are files mounted into the container.

Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.

This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1.

Ports can be either\na single value or a range. Host and container must use equivalent ranges.\n\nEither specify both ports (`HOST:CONTAINER`), or just the container port. In\nthe latter case, the container runtime automatically allocates any unassigned\nport of the host.\n\n`HOST:CONTAINER` should always be specified as a (quoted) string, to avoid\nconflicts with [yaml base-60 float](https://yaml.org/type/float.html).\n\nExamples:\n\n    \n    \n    ports:\n      - \"3000\"\n      - \"3000-3005\"\n      - \"8000:8000\"\n      - \"9090-9091:8080-8081\"\n      - \"49100:22\"\n      - \"8000-9000:80\"\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8001:8001\"\n      - \"127.0.0.1:5000-5010:5000-5010\"\n      - \"6060:6060/udp\"\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> If Host IP mapping is not supported by a container engine, Compose rejects\n> the Compose file and ignores the specified host IP.\n\n### Long syntax\n\nThe long form syntax allows the configuration of additional fields that can't\nbe expressed in the short form.",

Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project).

You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all\nthis time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For\na more thorough introduction, please refer to our [Introduction to Dependency\nMechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html).\n\nThe `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` lists all of the external\ndependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that\ndependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our\nproject is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering\nstuff for clarity):\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n    \n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <packaging>jar</packaging>\n    \n      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>\n      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n    \n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.11</version>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nFor each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things:\ngroupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version\nare the same as those given in the `pom.xml` for the project that built that\ndependency.

      "xml` and executing on the command line: `mvn\nhelp:effective-pom`\n\n#### Dependency Management\n\nBesides inheriting certain top-level elements, parents have elements to\nconfigure values for child POMs and transitive dependencies. One of those\nelements is `dependencyManagement`.\n\n  * **dependencyManagement** : is used by a POM to help manage dependency information across all of its children. If the `my-parent` project uses `dependencyManagement` to define a dependency on `junit:junit:4.12`, then POMs inheriting from this one can set their dependency giving the `groupId`=`junit` and `artifactId`=`junit` only and Maven will fill in the `version` set by the parent. The benefits of this method are obvious. Dependency details can be set in one central location, which propagates to all inheriting POMs. \n\nNote that the version and scope of artifacts which are incorporated from\ntransitive dependencies are also controlled by version specifications in a\ndependency management section. This can lead to unexpected consequences.\nConsider a case in which your project uses two dependences, `dep1` and `dep2`.\n`dep2` in turn also uses `dep1`, and requires a particular minimum version to\nfunction. If you then use `dependencyManagement` to specify an older version,\n`dep2` will be forced to use the older version, and fail. So, you must be\ncareful to check the entire dependency tree to avoid this problem; `mvn\ndependency:tree` is helpful.\n\n### Aggregation (or Multi-Module)\n\nA project with modules is known as a multi-module, or aggregator project.\nModules are projects that this POM lists, and are executed as a group. A `pom`\npackaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them\nas modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of\nthose projects."

In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository.

Introduced in Docker Compose version [2.17.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2170).\n\n  * `condition`: Sets the condition under which dependency is considered satisfied\n\n    * `service_started`: An equivalent of the short syntax described above\n    * `service_healthy`: Specifies that a dependency is expected to be \"healthy\" (as indicated by healthcheck) before starting a dependent service.\n    * `service_completed_successfully`: Specifies that a dependency is expected to run to successful completion before starting a dependent service.\n  * `required`: When set to `false` Compose only warns you when the dependency service isn't started or available. If it's not defined the default value of `required` is `true`. Introduced in Docker Compose version [2.20.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2200).\n\nService dependencies cause the following behaviors:\n\n  * Compose creates services in dependency order. In the following example, `db` and `redis` are created before `web`.\n\n  * Compose waits for healthchecks to pass on dependencies marked with `service_healthy`. In the following example, `db` is expected to be \"healthy\" before `web` is created.\n\n  * Compose removes services in dependency order. In the following example, `web` is removed before `db` and `redis`.\n\n    \n    \n    services:\n      web:\n        build: .\n        depends_on:\n          db:\n            condition: service_healthy\n            restart: true\n          redis:\n            condition: service_started\n      redis:\n        image: redis\n      db:\n        image: postgres\n\nCompose guarantees dependency services are started before starting a dependent\nservice.

A\nservice is an abstract concept implemented on platforms by running the same\ncontainer image, and configuration, one or more times.\n\nServices communicate with each other through\n[networks](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/06-networks/). In the\nCompose Specification, a network is a platform capability abstraction to\nestablish an IP route between containers within services connected together.\n\nServices store and share persistent data into\n[volumes](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/07-volumes/). The\nSpecification describes such a persistent data as a high-level filesystem\nmount with global options.\n\nSome services require configuration data that is dependent on the runtime or\nplatform. For this, the Specification defines a dedicated\n[configs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/08-configs/) concept.\nFrom a service container point of view, configs are comparable to volumes, in\nthat they are files mounted into the container. But the actual definition\ninvolves distinct platform resources and services, which are abstracted by\nthis type.\n\nA [secret](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/09-secrets/) is a\nspecific flavor of configuration data for sensitive data that should not be\nexposed without security considerations. Secrets are made available to\nservices as files mounted into their containers, but the platform-specific\nresources to provide sensitive data are specific enough to deserve a distinct\nconcept and definition within the Compose specification.\n\n>  **Note**\n>\n> With volumes, configs and secrets you can have a simple declaration at the\n> top-level and then add more platform-specific information at the service\n> level.\n\nA project is an individual deployment of an application specification on a\nplatform. A project's name, set with the top-level\n[`name`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/04-version-and-name/)\nattribute, is used to group resources together and isolate them from other\napplications or other installation of the same Compose-specified application\nwith distinct parameters.

For more information\non everything you can specify for a dependency, see the [Project Descriptor\nReference](/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html).\n\nFor more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see\n[Introduction to Dependency Mechanism](../introduction/introduction-to-\ndependency-mechanism.html).\n\nWith this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the\ndependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the\ndependency from? Maven looks in your local repository\n(`${user.home}/.m2/repository` is the default location) to find all\ndependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our\nproject (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's\ninstalled there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply\nby adding the dependency information to its `pom.xml`:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n      <artifactId>my-other-app</artifactId>\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        ...\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>\n          <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>\n          <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n          <scope>compile</scope>\n        </dependency>\n      </dependencies>\n    </project>\n\nWhat about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local\nrepository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in\nthe local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote\nrepository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a\nlot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were\ndependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default,\nthe remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at\n<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/>.",
      "Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation,\nas well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings\nin the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing\nyour list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n          <groupId>junit</groupId>\n          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n          <version>4.12</version>\n          <type>jar</type>\n          <scope>test</scope>\n          <optional>true</optional>\n        </dependency>\n        ...\n      </dependencies>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\n  * **groupId** , **artifactId** , **version** :  \nYou will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven\ncoordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of\nthis project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that\nmatches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there\ncan be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values\nshould be:\n\n    * **groupId** , **artifactId** : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency,\n    * **version** : a **dependency version requirement specification** , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version.\n\nSince the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking:\n\"This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!\" The answer\nis, \"Of course, but that's a good thing.\" This forces you to depend solely on\ndependencies that Maven can manage.\n\nThere are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the\ncentral Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that\nhas a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central\nrepository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario.\n\n    1. Install the dependency locally using the install plugin."
