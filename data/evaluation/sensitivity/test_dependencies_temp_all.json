'in' refers to the port inside the container, while 'out' refers to the port on the host that it is mapped to. In many cases, the same value for both might be a convention for simplicity, but does this equality represent a dependency? Looking at similar examples provided, in one case where Eureka service's external port was specified and ace-auth used an environment variable pointing to that port, there was a dependency. However, in another example with Docker Compose ports, the same values weren't necessarily dependent unless required for communication between services. Here, since litemall is likely a single service, setting both in and out to 8080 may be redundant but not functionally dependent. If the mapping were different, the service would still run; it's just exposed on a different host port. Therefore, this equality isn't required for functionality, so no dependency exists.",

Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3.
