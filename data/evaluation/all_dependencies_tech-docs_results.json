We could make it into\na `war` by declaring a different packaging:\n\n    \n    \n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n      ...\n      <packaging>war</packaging>\n      ...\n    </project>\n\nWhen no packaging is declared, Maven assumes the packaging is the default:\n`jar`. The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a\nexplanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role\n`org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping`. The current core\npackaging values are: `pom`, `jar`, `maven-plugin`, `ejb`, `war`, `ear`,\n`rar`. These define the default list of goals which execute on each\ncorresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see\n[Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference](/ref/current/maven-\ncore/default-bindings.html) for details.\n\n## POM Relationships\n\nOne powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this\nincludes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and\naggregation (multi-module projects).\n\nDependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for\nanything but the most trivial of projects. _\" Jarmageddon\"_ quickly ensues as\nthe dependency tree becomes large and complicated. _\" Jar Hell\"_ follows,\nwhere versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the\nversions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting\nversions between similarly named jars.\n\nMaven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to\nlink projects correctly, versions and all.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe cornerstone of the POM is its [dependency](/ref/current/maven-\nmodel/maven.html#class_dependency) list. Most projects depend on others to\nbuild and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you\nhave gained a lot.\n\nElement | Type | Description  \n---|---|---  \n`maven` |  `String` | For a plugin project (packaging is `maven-plugin`), the minimum version of Maven required to use the resulting plugin.   \nIn Maven 2, this was also specifying the minimum version of Maven required to\nbuild a project, but this usage is **deprecated** in Maven 3 and not checked\nany more: use the [Maven Enforcer Plugin's `requireMavenVersion`\nrule](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-\nrules/requireMavenVersion.html) instead. **Default value** : `2.0`  \n  \n### scm\n\nThe `<scm>` element contains informations required to the SCM (Source Control\nManagement) of the project.\n\nAttribute | Type | Description  \n---|---|---  \n`child.scm.connection.inherit.append.path` |  `String` | When children inherit from scm connection, append path or not? Note: While the type of this field is `String` for technical reasons, the semantic type is actually `Boolean`   \n**Default value is** : `true`  \n**Since** : Maven 3.6.1  \n`child.scm.developerConnection.inherit.append.path` |  `String` | When children inherit from scm developer connection, append path or not?

This connection is read-only.\n\nUnderstanding the POM is important and new users are\nencouraged to refer to the [Introduction to the\nPOM](../introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).\n\nThis is a very simple POM but still displays the key elements every POM\ncontains, so let's walk through each of them to familiarize you with the POM\nessentials:\n\n  * **project** This is the top-level element in all Maven `pom.xml` files.\n  * **modelVersion** This element indicates what version of the object model this POM is using. The version of the model itself changes very infrequently but it is mandatory in order to ensure stability of use if and when the Maven developers deem it necessary to change the model.\n  * **groupId** This element indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example `org.apache.maven.plugins` is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.\n  * **artifactId** This element indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form <artifactId>-<version>.<extension> (for example, `myapp-1.0.jar`).\n  * **version** This element indicates the version of the artifact generated by the project. Maven goes a long way to help you with version management and you will often see the `SNAPSHOT` designator in a version, which indicates that a project is in a state of development. We will discuss the use of [snapshots](./index.html#what-is-a-snapshot-version) and how they work further on in this guide.\n  * **name** This element indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.\n  * **url** This element indicates where the project's site can be found. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.\n  * **properties** This element contains value placeholders accessible anywhere within a POM.\n  * **dependencies** This element's children list [dependencies](/pom.html#dependencies). The cornerstone of the POM.\n\n* `(,1.0]`: Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0. \n  * `[1.2,1.3]`: Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.\n  * `[1.0,2.0)`: 1.0 <= x < 2.0; Hard requirement for any version between 1.0 inclusive and 2.0 exclusive.\n  * `[1.5,)`: Hard requirement for any version greater than or equal to 1.5.\n  * `(,1.0],[1.2,)`: Hard requirement for any version less than or equal to 1.0 than or greater than or equal to 1.2, but not 1.1. Multiple requirements are separated by commas.\n  * `(,1.1),(1.1,)`: Hard requirement for any version except 1.1; for example because 1.1 has a critical vulnerability. \n\nMaven picks the highest version of each project that satisfies all the hard\nrequirements of the dependencies on that project. If no version satisfies all\nthe hard requirements, the build fails.\n\n#### Version Order Specification:\n\nIf version strings are syntactically correct [Semantic Versioning\n1.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html) version numbers, then in almost\nall cases version comparison follows the precedence rules outlined in that\nspecification. These versions are the commonly encountered alphanumeric ASCII\nstrings such as 2.15.2-alpha. More precisely, this is true if both version\nnumbers to be compared match the \"valid semver\" production in the BNF grammar\nin the semantic versioning specification. Maven does not consider any\nsemantics implied by that specification.\n\n**Important** : This is only true for Semantic Versioning _1.0.0_. The Maven\nversion order algorithm is not compatible with Semantic Versioning _2.0.0_. In\nparticular, Maven does not special case the plus sign or consider build\nidentifiers.\n\nWhen version strings do not follow semantic versioning, a more complex set of\nrules is required. The Maven coordinate is split in tokens between dots\n('`.`'), hyphens ('`-`'), underscore ('`_`') and transitions between digits\nand characters. The separator is recorded and will have effect on the order.",
