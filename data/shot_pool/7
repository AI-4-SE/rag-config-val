Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.build.finalName of type NAME with value ace-gate in ace-gate/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.artifactId of type NAME with value ace-gate in 'ace-gate/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

{
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.build.finalName with the value ace-gate in ace-gate/pom.xml specifies the final name of the built artifact. The configuration option project.artifactId with the same value ace-gate in the same pom.xml identifies the artifact's unique ID within the project. Typically, the finalName is often derived from or set to match the artifactId. In this case, the finalName depends on the artifactId because the artifactId is a more fundamental identifier within the Maven project, and finalName is typically configured to reflect the artifactId.",
