Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.build.finalName of type NAME with value ace-gate in ace-gate/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.artifactId of type NAME with value ace-gate in 'ace-gate/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

{
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.build.finalName with the value ace-gate in ace-gate/pom.xml specifies the final name of the built artifact. The configuration option project.artifactId with the same value ace-gate in the same pom.xml identifies the artifact's unique ID within the project. Typically, the finalName is often derived from or set to match the artifactId. In this case, the finalName depends on the artifactId because the artifactId is a more fundamental identifier within the Maven project, and finalName is typically configured to reflect the artifactId.",
