Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.modules.module of type NAME with value apollo-configservice in pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option spring.application.name of type NAME with value apollo-configservice in apollo-configservice/src/test/resources/application.yml of technology spring or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.modules.module with the value apollo-configservice in pom.xml defines a module within a Maven multi-module project. The configuration option spring.application.name with the same value apollo-configservice in the application.yml file specifies the name of the Spring application. The Maven module's name and the Spring application name are aligned, as they reference a common name in project that frequently appears in the project. So, the identical value does not indicate a dependency.",
