Carefully evaluate whether configuration option FROM of type UNKNOWN with value registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dockerhub_mirror/java:21-anolis in pig-visual/pig-quartz/Dockerfile of technology docker depends on configuration option FROM of type UNKNOWN with value registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dockerhub_mirror/java:21-anolis in pig-visual/pig-monitor/Dockerfile of technology docker or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",    
    "rationale": "The configuration option FROM in pig-visual/pig-quartz/Dockerfile and pig-visual/pig-monitor/Dockerfile both specify the same base image 'registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/dockerhub_mirror/java:21-anolis'. Although both Dockerfiles use the same base image, this does not imply a dependency between them, since each Dockerfile is independent and build its respective Docker image. Therefore, there cannot be a value-equality dependency between options from different Dockerfiles.",
