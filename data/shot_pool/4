Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.dependencyManagement.dependencies.dependency_awaitility.scope of type UNKNOWN with value test in pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_h2.scope of type UNKNOWN with value test in apollo-build-sql-converter/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

While both scopes are set to 'test', is does not create a dependency between these Maven dependencies, as each Maven dependency independently defines its scope.",
