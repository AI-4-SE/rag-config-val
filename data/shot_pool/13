Carefully evaluate whether configuration option services.statistics-mongodb.restart of type MODE with value always in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose  depends on configuration option services.monitoring.restart of type MODE with value always in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

{
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The 'restart' option in docker-compose.yml specifies the restart policy for a service. The value 'always' means that the service will always be restarted if it stops. This setting is typically used to ensure high availability and resilience of services. Each service can have its own restart policy independently of the other and therefore the similarity of their values does not indicate a dependency.",
