Carefully evaluate whether configuration option services.consul.ports.out of type PORT with value 8500 in spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-consul/docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose depends on configuration option services.consul.ports.in of type PORT with value 8500 in spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-consul/docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "In Docker Compose, the 'ports' configuration typically maps a port on the host to a port on the container. The 'in' port refers to the internal port within the container, while the 'out' port refers to the external port on the host. These ports do not need to be the same for the service to function correctly; they can be different. It is common to map the same port on the host for simplicity. However, this is not a requirement, and the service would still function if the ports were different.",
