Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.parent_litemall.artifactId of type NAME with value litemall in litemall-wx-api/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option ervices.litemall.container_name of type NAME with value litemall in docker/docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

{
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.parent_litemall.artifactId and services.litemall.container_name refer to the same name 'litemall', which is the project name and thus frequently appearing. However, these configurations serve different purposes: one is for Maven project management, and the other is for container orchestration. Therefore, the options do not depend on each other due to value-equality.",
    "isDependency": false
