Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.parent_litemall.artifactId of type NAME with value litemall in litemall-wx-api/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option ervices.litemall.container_name of type NAME with value litemall in docker/docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

{
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.parent_litemall.artifactId and services.litemall.container_name refer to the same name 'litemall', which is the project name and thus frequently appearing. However, these configurations serve different purposes: one is for Maven project management, and the other is for container orchestration. Therefore, the options do not depend on each other due to value-equality.",
