Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.dependencyManagement.dependencies.dependency_litemall-admin-api.groupId of type NAME with value org.linlinjava in pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.parent_litemall.groupId of type NAME with value org.linlinjava in litemall-core/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The 'groupId' in Maven is used to uniquely identify a project across all projects. The options depend on each other as litemall-admin-api is a specific module in the litemall project and therefore needs to specificy the same groupID used in the project to identify all modules.",
    "isDependency": true
