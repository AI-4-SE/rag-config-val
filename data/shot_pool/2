Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.parent_pig-common.artifactId of type NAME with value pig-common in pig-common/pig-common-seata/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.parent_pig-common.artifactId of type NAME with value pig-common in pig-common/pig-common-mybatis/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "Both, pig-common-seata and pig-common-mybatis are submodule in the pig project and inherit the artifactID from the parent module pig-common. Due to project inheritance, these options depend on each other due to value-equality.",
    "isDependency": true
