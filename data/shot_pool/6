Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-cloud-starter-sleuth.artifactId of type NAME with value spring-cloud-starter-sleuth in notification-service/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-cloud-starter-sleuth.artifactId of type NAME with value spring-cloud-starter-sleuth in account-service/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

{
    "rationale": "The artifactId 'spring-cloud-starter-sleut' in both configurations is referring to the same Maven dependency in different modules. In Maven, dependencies are identified by their groupId, artifactId, and version. As both configurations are part of the same project, it is essential for them to have the same artifactId to ensure that the correct dependency is referenced. It therefore indicates a value-equality dependency.",
