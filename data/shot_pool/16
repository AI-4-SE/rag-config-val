Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in litemall-all/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in litemall-admin-api/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

{
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The 'project.modelVersion' in a Maven project typically specifies the version of the POM model being used. Maven currently only supports the model version 4.0.0 and this is required all modules to ensure compatibility. Therefore, the project.modelVersion must be consistent across all modules, creating a dependency based on value-equality.",
