Carefully evaluate whether configuration option services.eureka.ports.out of type PORT with value 8761 in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose depends on configuration option services.ace-auth.environment.EUREKA_PORT of type PORT with value 8761 in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration option services.eureka.ports.out in docker-compose.yml specifies the external port (8761) exposed by the Eureka service container. The option services.ace-auth.environment.EUREKA_PORT in the same docker-compose.yml specifies an environment variable EUREKA_PORT, likely used to configure the ace-auth service to connect to the Eureka service on port 8761. The value equality (8761) indicates that the ace-auth service relies on the Eureka service being available on this specific port. This setup shows a dependency because the ace-auth configuration expects the Eureka service to be accessible at the port defined by services.eureka.ports.out.",
