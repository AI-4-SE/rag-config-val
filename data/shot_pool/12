Carefully evaluate whether configuration option services.eureka.ports.out of type PORT with value 8761 in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose depends on configuration option services.ace-auth.environment.EUREKA_PORT of type PORT with value 8761 in docker-compose.yml of technology docker-compose or vice versa.

{
    "rationale": "The configuration option services.eureka.ports.out in docker-compose.yml specifies the external port (8761) exposed by the Eureka service container. The option services.ace-auth.environment.EUREKA_PORT in the same docker-compose.yml specifies an environment variable EUREKA_PORT, likely used to configure the ace-auth service to connect to the Eureka service on port 8761. The value equality (8761) indicates that the ace-auth service relies on the Eureka service being available on this specific port. This setup shows a dependency because the ace-auth configuration expects the Eureka service to be accessible at the port defined by services.eureka.ports.out.",
    "isDependency": true
