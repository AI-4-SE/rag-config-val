Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in mall-security/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in mall-search/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

    "rationale": "The 'project.modelVersion' in a Maven project defines the version of the POM model being used. Maven exclusively supports model version 4.0.0, which must be used across all modules to maintain compatibility. As a result, the project.modelVersion needs to be the same across all modules, establishing a dependency based on value equality.",
