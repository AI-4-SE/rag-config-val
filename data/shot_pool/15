Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in mall-security/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.modelVersion of type VERSION_NUMBER with value modelVersion:4.0.0 in mall-search/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

 {
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The 'project.modelVersion' in a Maven project defines the version of the POM model being used. Maven exclusively supports model version 4.0.0, which must be used across all modules to maintain compatibility. As a result, the project.modelVersion needs to be the same across all modules, establishing a dependency based on value equality.",
    "isDependency": true
