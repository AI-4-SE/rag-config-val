Carefully evaluate whether configuration option spring.datasource.username of type USERNAME with value root in ace-modules/ace-sample/src/main/resources/application.yml of technology spring depends on configuration option spring.sample-datasource.username of type USERNAME with value root in ace-modules/ace-generator/src/main/resources/application.yml of technology spring or vice versa.

    "rationale": "The configuration options spring.datasource.username in ace-modules/ace-sample/src/main/resources/application.yml and spring.sample-datasource.username in ace-modules/ace-generator/src/main/resources/application.yml do not inherently depend on each other despite both having the value 'root'. Typically, each module in a project has its own datasource. Therefore, the similarity in their values does not indicate a dependency between them.",
