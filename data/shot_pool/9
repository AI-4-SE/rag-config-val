Carefully evaluate whether configuration option spring.datasource.username of type USERNAME with value root in ace-modules/ace-sample/src/main/resources/application.yml of technology spring depends on configuration option spring.sample-datasource.username of type USERNAME with value root in ace-modules/ace-generator/src/main/resources/application.yml of technology spring or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration options spring.datasource.username in ace-modules/ace-sample/src/main/resources/application.yml and spring.sample-datasource.username in ace-modules/ace-generator/src/main/resources/application.yml do not inherently depend on each other despite both having the value 'root'. Typically, each module in a project has its own datasource. Therefore, the similarity in their values does not indicate a dependency between them.",
