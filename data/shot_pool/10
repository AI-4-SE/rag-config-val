Carefully evaluate whether configuration option spring.datasource.password of type PASSWORD with value 123456 in music-server/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties of technology spring depends on configuration option spring.datasource.password of type PASSWORD with value 123456 in music-server/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties of technology spring or vice versa.

{
    "rationale": "The configuration options spring.datasource.password in music-server/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties and spring.datasource.password in music-server/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties are used in different environments (production and development), and each is likely defined independently for its specific environment and uses its own datasource. Therefore, there is no dependency between these options based on value-equality."
    "isDependency": false
