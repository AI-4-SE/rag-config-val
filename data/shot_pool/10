Carefully evaluate whether configuration option spring.datasource.password of type PASSWORD with value 123456 in music-server/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties of technology spring depends on configuration option spring.datasource.password of type PASSWORD with value 123456 in music-server/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties of technology spring or vice versa.

{
    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration options spring.datasource.password in music-server/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties and spring.datasource.password in music-server/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties are used in different environments (production and development), and each is likely defined independently for its specific environment and uses its own datasource. Therefore, there is no dependency between these options based on value-equality.",
