Carefully evaluate whether configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-boot-starter-test.groupId of type NAME with value org.springframework.boot in registry/pom.xml of technology maven depends on configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-boot-starter-security.groupId of type NAME with value org.springframework.boot in account-service/pom.xml of technology maven or vice versa.

    "plan": "1. Identify and compare the configuration options in questions. 2. Analyze the additional context and similar classified examples to determine if their values are required to be equal for the system to function correctly or if this equality is coincidental. 3. Check for any references or documentation that explicitly state a dependency between thes configuration options. 4. Conclude wether a value-equality dependency exists based on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "The configuration option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-boot-starter-test.groupId and the option project.dependencies.dependency_spring-boot-starter-security.groupId located in different modules and indicate different Maven dependencies. The equality of the groupId values indicates that they are part of the same Spring Boot ecosystem, but there is no dependency between these two configuration options based on their groupId values.",
